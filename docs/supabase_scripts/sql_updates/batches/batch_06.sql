UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'IN writing this ponderous tome, the author’s desire has been to describe
      the eminent characters and remarkable events of our annals in such a form
      and style that the YOUNG may make acquaintance with them of their own
      accord. For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a
      chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of
      authentic history. The chair is made to pass from one to another of those
      personages of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to
      have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best
      enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken
      legs it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to
      thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever an
      historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.

There is certainly no method by which the shadowy outlines of departed men
      and women can be made to assume the hues of life more effectually than by
      connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of a
      fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once that these characters of
      history had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly
      contained within that cold array of outward action which we are compelled
      to receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this
      impression can be given, much is accomplished.

Setting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures
      of the chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing
      pages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes
      assumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details for
      which he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not
      violate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this
      respect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions
      of which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind.

The author’s great doubt is, whether he has succeeded in writing a book
      which will be readable by the class for whom he intends it. To make a
      lively and entertaining narrative for children, with such unmalleable
      material as is presented by the sombre, stern, and rigid characteristics
      of the Puritans and their descendants, is quite as difficult an attempt as
      to manufacture delicate playthings out of the granite, rocks on which New
      England is founded.

GRANDFATHER had been sitting in his old arm-chair all that pleasant
      afternoon, while the children were pursuing their various sports far off
      or near at hand, Sometimes you would have said, “Grandfather is asleep;”
       hut still, even when his eyes were closed, his thoughts were with the
      young people, playing among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.

He heard the voice of Laurence, who had taken possession of a heap of
      decayed branches which the gardener had lopped from the fruit-trees, and
      was building a little hut for his cousin Clara and himself. He heard
      Clara’s gladsome voice, too, as she weeded and watered the flower-bed
      which had been given her for her own. He could have counted every footstep
      that Charley took, as he trundled his wheelbarrow along the gravel-walk.
      And though’ Grandfather was old and gray-haired, yet his heart leaped with
      joy whenever little Alice came fluttering, like a butterfly, into the
      room. Sire had made each of the children her playmate in turn, and now
      made Grandfather her playmate too, and thought him the merriest of them
      all.

At last the children grew weary of their sports, because a summer
      afternoon is like a long lifetime to the young. So they came into the room
      together, and clustered round Grandfather’s great chair. Little Alice, who
      was hardly five years old, took the privilege of the youngest, and climbed
      his knee. It was a pleasant thing to behold that fair and golden-haired
      child in the lap of the old man, and to think that, different as they
      were, the hearts of both could be gladdened with the same joys.

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, laying her head back upon his arm, “I am
      very tired now. You must tell me a story to make me go to sleep.”

“That is not what story-tellers like,” answered Grandfather, smiling.
      “They are better satisfied when they can keep their auditors awake.”

“But here are Laurence, and Charley, and I,” cried cousin Clara, who was
      twice as old as little Alice. “We will all three keep wide awake. And
      pray, Grandfather, tell us a story about this strange-looking old chair.”

Now, the chair in which Grandfather sat was made of oak, which had grown
      dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as
      mahogany. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose high above
      Grandfather’s white head. This back was curiously carved in open work, so
      as to represent flowers, and foliage, and other devices, which the
      children had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant.
      On the very tip-top of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself,
      was a likeness of a lion’s head, which had such a savage grin that you
      would almost expect to hear it growl and snarl.

The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they
      could remember anything. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and
      the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been
      as old as they were now. At this time, however, it happened to be the
      fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest
      chairs that could be found. It seemed to cousin Clara that, if these
      ladies could have seen Grandfather’s old chair, they would have thought it
      worth all the rest together. She wondered if it were not even older than
      Grandfather himself, and longed to know all about its history.

“Well, child,” said Grandfather, patting Clara’s cheek, “I can tell you a
      great many stories of my chair. Perhaps your cousin Laurence would like to
      hear them too. They would teach him something about the history and
      distinguished people of his country which he has never read in any of his
      schoolbooks.”

Cousin Laurence was a boy of twelve, a bright scholar, in whom an early
      thoughtfulness and sensibility began to show themselves. His young fancy
      kindled at the idea of knowing all the adventures of this venerable chair.
      He looked eagerly in Grandfather’s face; and even Charley, a bold, brisk,
      restless little fellow of nine, sat himself down on the carpet, and
      resolved to be quiet for at least ten minutes, should the story last so
      long.

Meantime, little Alice was already asleep; so Grandfather, being much
      pleased with such an attentive audience, began to talk about matters that
      happened long ago.

BUT before relating the adventures of the chairs found it necessary to
      speak of circumstances that caused the first settlement of New England.
      For it will soon be perceived that the story of this remarkable chair
      cannot be told without telling a great deal of the history of the country.

So Grandfather talked about the Puritans, {Foot Note: It is more precise
      to give the name of Pilgrims to those Englishmen who went to Holland and
      afterward to Plymouth. They were sometimes called Separatists because they
      separated themselves from the church of England, sometimes Brownists after
      the name of one of their eminent ministers. The Puritans formed a great
      political as well as religious party in England, and did not at first
      separate themselves from the church of England, though those who came to
      this country did so at once.} as those persons were called who thought it
      sinful to practise certain religious forms and ceremonies of the Church of
      England. These Puritans suffered so much persecuted in England that, in
      1607, many of them went over to Holland, and lived ten or twelve years at
      Amsterdam and Leyden. But they feared that, if they continued there much
      longer, they should cease to be England, and should adopt all the manners,
      and ideas, and feelings of the Dutch. For this and other reasons, in the
      year 1620 they embarked on board the ship Mayflower, and crossed the
      ocean, to the shores of Cape Cod. There they made a settlement, and called
      it Plymouth, which, though now a part of Massachusetts, was for a long
      time a colony by itself. And thus was formed the earliest settlement of
      the Puritans in America.

Meantime, those of the Puritans who remained in England continued to
      suffer grievous persecution on account of their religious opinions. They
      began to look around them for some spot where they might worship God, not
      as the king and bishops thought fit, but according to the dictates of
      their own consciences. When their brethren had gone from Holland to
      America, they bethought themselves that they likewise might find refuge
      from persecution there. Several gentlemen among them purchased a tract of
      country on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, and obtained a charter from
      King Charles, which authorized them to make laws for the settlers. In the
      year 1628 they sent over a few people, with John Endicott at their bead,
      to commence a plantation at Salem. {Foot Note: The Puritans had a liking
      for Biblical names for their children, and they sometimes gave names out
      of the Bible to places, Salem means Peace. The Indian name was Naumkeag.}
      Peter Palfrey, Roger Conant, and one or two more had built houses there in
      1626, and may be considered as the first settlers of that ancient town.
      Many other Puritans prepared to follow Endicott.

“And now we come to the chair, my dear children,” said Grandfather. “This
      chair is supposed to have been made of an oak-tree which grew in the park
      of the English Earl of Lincoln between two and three centuries ago. In its
      younger days it used, probably, to stand in the hall of the earl’s castle.
      Do not you see the coat of arms of the family of Lincoln carved in the
      open work of the back? But when his daughter, the Lady Arbella, was
      married to a certain Mr. Johnson, the earl gave her this valuable chair.”

“He was a gentleman of great wealth, who agreed with the Puritans in their
      religious opinions,” answered Grandfather. “And as his belief was the same
      as theirs, he resolved that he would live and die with them. Accordingly,
      in the month of April, 1630, he left his pleasant abode and all his
      comforts in England, and embarked, with Lady Arbella, on board of a ship
      bound for America.”

As Grandfather was frequently impeded by the questions and observations of
      his young auditors, we deem it advisable to omit all such prattle as is
      not essential to the story. We have taken some pains to find out exactly
      what Grandfather said, and here offer to our readers, as nearly as
      possible in his own words, the story of the Lady Arbella.

The ship in which Mr. Johnson and his lady embarked, taking Grandfather’s
      chair along with them, was called the Arbella, in honor of the lady
      herself. A fleet of ten or twelve vessels, with many hundred passengers,
      left England about the same time; for a multitude of people, who were
      discontented with the king’s government and oppressed by the bishops, were
      flocking over to the New World. One of the vessels in the fleet was that
      same Mayflower which had carried the Puritan Pilgrims to Plymouth. And
      now, my children, I would have you fancy yourselves in the cabin of the
      good ship Arbella; because, if you could behold the passengers aboard that
      vessel, you would feel what a blessing and honor it was for New England to
      have such settlers. They were the best men and women of their day.

Among the passengers was John Winthrop, who had sold the estate of his
      forefathers, and was going to prepare a new home for his wife and children
      in the wilderness. He had the king’s charter in his keeping, and was
      appointed the first governor of Massachusetts. Imagine him a person of
      grave and benevolent aspect, dressed in a black velvet suit, with a broad
      ruff around his neck, and a peaked beard upon his chin. {Foot Note: There
      is a statue representing John Winthrop in Scollay Square in Boston. He
      holds the charter in his hand, and a Bible is under his arm.} There was
      likewise a minister of the gospel whom the English bishops had forbidden
      to preach, but who knew that he should have liberty both to preach and
      pray in the forests of America. He wore a black cloak, called a Geneva
      cloak, and had a black velvet cap, fitting close to his head, as was the
      fashion of almost all the Puritan clergymen. In their company came Sir
      Richard Saltonstall, who had been one of the five first projectors of the
      new colony. He soon returned to his native country. But his descendants
      still remain in New England; and the good old family name is as much
      respected in our days as it was in those of Sir Richard.

Not only these, but several other men of wealth and pious ministers were
      in the cabin of the Arbella. One had banished himself forever from the old
      hall where his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. Another had left
      his quiet parsonage, in a country town of England. Others had come from
      the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, where they had gained great fame
      for their learning. And here they all were, tossing upon the uncertain and
      dangerous sea, and bound for a home that was more dangerous than even the
      sea itself. In the cabin, likewise, sat the Lady Arbella in her chair,
      with a gentle and sweet expression on her face, but looking too pale and
      feeble to endure the hardships of the wilderness.

Every morning and evening the Lady Arbella gave up her great chair to one
      of the ministers, who took his place in it and read passages from the
      Bible to his companions. And thus, with prayers, and pious conversation,
      and frequent singing of hymns, which the breezes caught from their lips
      and scattered far over the desolate waves, they prosecuted their voyage,
      and sailed into the harbor of Salem in the month of June.

At that period there were but six or eight dwellings in the town; and
      these were miserable hovels, with roofs of straw and wooden chimneys. The
      passengers in the fleet either built huts with bark and branches of trees,
      or erected tents of cloth till they could provide themselves with better
      shelter. Many of them went to form a settlement at Charlestown. It was
      thought fit that the Lady Arbella should tarry in Salem for a time; she
      was probably received as a guest into the family of John Endicott. He was
      the chief person in the plantation, and had the only comfortable house
      which the new-comers had beheld since they left England. So now, children,
      you must imagine Grandfather’s chair in the midst of a new scene.

Suppose it a hot summer’s day, and the lattice-windows of a chamber in Mr.
      Endicott’s house thrown wide open. The Lady Arbella, looking paler than
      she did on shipboard, is sitting in her chair, and thinking mournfully of
      far-off England. She rises and goes to the window. There, amid patches Of
      garden ground and cornfield, she sees the few wretched hovels of the
      settlers, with the still ruder wigwams and cloth tents of the passengers
      who had arrived in the same fleet with herself. Far and near stretches the
      dismal forest of pine-trees, which throw their black shadows over the
      whole land, and likewise over the heart of this poor lady.

All the inhabitants of the little village are busy. One is clearing a spot
      on the verge of the forest for his homestead; another is hewing the trunk
      of a fallen pine-tree, in order to build himself a dwelling; a third is
      hoeing in his field of Indian corn. Here comes a huntsman out of the
      woods, dragging a bear which he has shot, and shouting to the neighbors to
      lend him a hand. There goes a man to the sea-shore, with a spade and a
      bucket, to dig a mess of clams, which were a principal article of food
      with the first settlers. Scattered here and there are two or three dusky
      figures, clad in mantles of fur, with ornaments of bone hanging from their
      ears, and the feathers of wild birds in their coal-black hair. They have
      belts of shellwork slung across their shoulders, and are armed with bows
      and arrows, and flint-headed spears. These are an Indian sagamore and his
      attendants, who have come to gaze at the labors of the white men. And now
      rises a cry that a pack of wolves have seized a young calf in the pasture;
      and every man snatches up his gun or pike and runs in chase of the
      marauding beasts.

Poor Lady Arbella watches all these sights, and feels that this New World
      is fit only for rough and hardy people. None should be here but those who
      can struggle with wild beasts and wild men, and can toil in the heat or
      cold, and can keep their hearts firm against all difficulties and dangers.
      But she is not of these. Her gentle and timid spirit sinks within her;
      and, turning away from the window, she sits down in the great chair and
      wonders whereabouts in the wilderness her friends will dig her grave.

Mr. Johnson had gone, with Governor Winthrop and most of the other
      passengers, to Boston, where he intended to build a house for Lady Arbella
      and himself. Boston was then covered with wild woods, and had fewer
      inhabitants, even, than Salem. During her husband’s absence, poor Lady
      Arbella felt herself growing ill, and was hardly able to stir from the
      great chair. Whenever John Endicott noticed her despondency he doubtless
      addressed her with words of comfort. “Cheer up, my good lady!” he would
      say.

“In a little time you will love this rude life of the wilderness as I do.”
       But Endicott’s heart was as bold and resolute as iron, and he could not
      understand why a woman’s heart should not be of iron too.

Still, however, he spoke kindly to the lady, and then hastened forth to
      till his cornfield and set out fruit-trees, or to bargain with the Indians
      for furs, or perchance to oversee the building of a fort. Also, being a
      magistrate, he had often to punish some idler or evil doer, by ordering
      him to be set in the stocks or scourged at the whipping-post. Often, too,
      as was the custom of the times, he and Mr. Higginson, the minister of
      Salem, held long religious talks together. Thus John Endicott was a man of
      multifarious business, and had no time to look back regretfully to his
      native land. He felt himself fit for the New World and for the work that
      he had to do, and set himself resolutely to accomplish it.

What a contrast, my dear children, between this bold, rough, active man,
      and the gentle Lady Arbella, who was fading away, like a pale English
      flower, in the shadow of the forest! And now the great chair was often
      empty, because Lady Arbella grew too weak to arise from bed.

Meantime, her husband had pitched upon a spot for their new home. He
      returned from Boston to Salem, travelling through the woods on foot, and
      leaning on his pilgrim’s staff. His heart yearned within him; for he was
      eager to tell his wife of the new home which he had chosen. But when he
      beheld her pale and hollow cheek, and found how her strength was wasted,
      he must have known that her appointed home was in a better land. Happy for
      him then—happy both for him and her—if they remembered that
      there was a path to heaven, as well from this heathen wilderness as from
      the Christian land whence they had come. And so, in one short month from
      her arrival, the gentle Lady Arbella faded away and died. They dug a grave
      for her in the new soil, where the roots of the pine-trees impeded their
      spades; and when her bones had rested there nearly two hundred years, and
      a city had sprung up around them, a church of stone was built upon the
      spot.

Charley, almost at the commencement of the foregoing narrative, had
      galloped away, with a prodigious clatter, upon Grandfather’s stick, and
      was not yet returned. So large a boy should have been ashamed to ride upon
      a stick. But Laurence and Clara had listened attentively, and were
      affected by this true story of the gentle lady who had come so far to die
      so soon. Grandfather had supposed that little Alice was asleep; but
      towards the close of the story, happening to look down upon her, he saw
      that her blue eyes were wide open, and fixed earnestly upon his face. The
      tears had gathered in them, like dew upon a delicate flower; but when
      Grandfather ceased to speak, the sunshine of her smile broke forth again.

“Oh, the lady must have been so glad to get to heaven!” exclaimed little
      Alice. “Grandfather, what became of Mr. Johnson?” asked Clara.

“His heart appears to have been quite broken,” answered Grandfather; “for
      he died at Boston within a month after the death of his wife. He was
      buried in the very same tract of ground where he had intended to build a
      dwelling for Lady Arbella and himself. Where their house would have stood,
      there was his grave.”

“The people loved and respected Mr. Johnson so much,” continued
      Grandfather, “that it was the last request of many of them, when they
      died, that they might be buried as near as possible to this good man’s
      grave. And so the field became the first burial ground in Boston. When you
      pass through Tremont Street, along by King’s Chapel, you see a
      burial-ground, containing many old grave-stones and monuments. That was
      Mr. Johnson’s field.”

“How sad is the thought,” observed Clara, “that one of the first things
      which the settlers had to do, when they came to the New World, was to set
      apart a burial-ground!”

“Perhaps,” said Laurence, “if they had found no need of burial-grounds
      here, they would have been glad, after a few years, to go back to
      England.”

Grandfather looked at Laurence, to discover whether he knew how profound
      and true a thing he had said.

NOT long after Grandfather had told the story of his great chair, there
      chanced to be a rainy day. Our friend Charley, after disturbing the
      household with beat of drum and riotous shouts, races up and down the
      staircase, overturning of chairs, and much other uproar, began to feel the
      quiet and confinement within doors intolerable. But as the rain came down
      in a flood, the little fellow was hopelessly a prisoner, and now stood
      with sullen aspect at a window, wondering whether the sun itself were not
      extinguished by so much moisture in the sky.

Charley had already exhausted the less eager activity of the other
      children; and they had betaken themselves to occupations that did not
      admit of his companionship. Laurence sat in a recess near the book-ease,
      reading, not for the first time, the Midsummer Night’s Dream. Clara was
      making a rosary of beads for a little figure of a Sister of Charity, who
      was to attend the Bunker Hill fair and lend her aid in erecting the
      Monument. Little Alice sat on Grandfather’s footstool, with a picture-book
      in her hand; and, for every picture, the child was telling Grandfather a
      story. She did not read from the book (for little Alice had not much skill
      in reading), but told the story out of her own heart and mind.

Charley was too big a boy, of course, to care anything about little
      Alice’s stories, although Grandfather appeared to listen with a good deal
      of interest. Often in a young child’s ideas and fancies, there, is
      something which it requires the thought of a lifetime to comprehend. But
      Charley was of opinion that, if a story must be told, it had better be
      told by Grandfather than little Alice.

Now, Grandfather remembered that Charley had galloped away upon a stick in
      the midst of the narrative of poor Lady Arbella, and I know not whether he
      would have thought it worth while to tell another story merely to gratify
      such an inattentive auditor as Charley. But Laurence laid down his book
      and seconded the request. Clara drew her chair nearer to Grandfather; and
      little Alice immediately closed her picture-book and looked up into his
      face. Grandfather had not the heart to disappoint them.

He mentioned several persons who had a share in the settlement of our
      country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find
      room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the
      famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the
      inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was
      chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children
      what became of this upright and zealous man at last. In fact, his auditors
      were growing impatient to hear more about the history of the chair.

“After the death of Mr. Johnson,” said he, “Grandfather’s chair came into
      the possession of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at
      Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a
      studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon or reading some
      abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that
      period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read
      or work by the light of pitch-pine torches. These supplied the place of
      the ‘midnight oil’ to the learned men of New England.”

Grandfather went on to talk about Roger Williams, and told the children
      several particulars, which we have not room to repeat.

“ROGER WILLIAMS,” said Grandfather, “did not keep possession of the chair
      a great while. His opinions of civil and religious matters differed, in
      many respects, from those of the rulers and clergymen of Massachusetts.
      Now, the wise men of those days believed that the country could not be
      safe unless all the inhabitants thought and felt alike.”

“Possibly there are some who believe it,” said Grandfather; “but they have
      not so much power to act upon their belief as the magistrates and
      ministers had in the days of Roger Williams. They had the power to deprive
      this good man of his home, and to send him out from the midst of them in
      search of a new place of rest. He was banished in 1634, and went first to
      Plymouth colony; but as the people there held the same opinions as those
      of Massachusetts, he was not suffered to remain among them. However, the
      wilderness was wide enough; so Roger Williams took his staff and travelled
      into the forest and made treaties with the Indians, and began a plantation
      which he called Providence.”

“Yes, Charley,” replied Grandfather; “but when Roger Williams travelled
      thither, over hills and valleys, and through the tangled woods, and across
      swamps and streams, it was a journey of several days. Well, his little
      plantation has now grown to be a populous city; and the inhabitants have a
      great veneration for Roger Williams. His name is familiar in the mouths of
      all, because they see it on their bank-bills. How it would have perplexed
      this good clergyman if he had been told that he should give his name to
      the ROGER WILLIAMS BANK!”

“When he was driven from Massachusetts,” said Lawrence, “and began his
      journey into the woods, he must have felt as if he were burying himself
      forever from the sight and knowledge of men. Yet the whole country has now
      heard of him, and will remember him forever.”

“Yes,” answered Grandfather; “it often happens that the outcasts of one
      generation are those who are reverenced as the wisest and best of men by
      the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man’s death. But
      let us return to our story. When Roger Williams was banished, he appears
      to have given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events, it was in
      her possession in 1687. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed
      lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities that she
      thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She
      therefore used to hold lectures in Boston once or twice a week, at which
      most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings,
      sitting with great state and dignity in Grandfather’s chair.”

“Grandfather, was it positively this very chair?” demanded Clara, laying
      her hand upon its carved elbow.

“Why not, my dear Clara?” said Grandfather. “Well, Mrs. Hutchinson’s
      lectures soon caused a great disturbance; for the ministers of Boston did
      not think it safe and proper that a woman should publicly instruct the
      people in religious doctrines. Moreover, she made the matter worse by
      declaring that the Rev. Mr. Cotton was the only sincerely pious and holy
      clergyman in New England. Now, the clergy of those days had quite as much
      share in the government of the country, though indirectly, as the
      magistrates themselves; so you may imagine what a host of powerful enemies
      were raised up against Mrs. Hutchinson. A synod was convened; that is to
      say, an assemblage of all the ministers in Massachusetts. They declared
      that there were eighty-two erroneous opinions on religious subjects
      diffused among the people, and that Mrs. Hutchinson’s opinions were of the
      number.”

“If they had eighty-two wrong opinions,” observed Charley, “I don’t see
      how they could have any right ones.”

“Mrs. Hutchinson had many zealous friends and converts,” continued
      Grandfather. “She was favored by young Henry Vane, who had come over from
      England a year or two before, and had since been chosen governor of the
      colony, at the age of twenty-four. But Winthrop and most of the other
      leading men, as well as the ministers, felt an abhorrence of her
      doctrines. Thus two opposite parties were formed; and so fierce were the
      dissensions that it was feared the consequence would be civil war and
      bloodshed. But Winthrop and the ministers being the most powerful, they
      disarmed and imprisoned Mrs. Hutchinson’s adherents. She, like Roger
      Williams, was banished.”

“Dear Grandfather, did they drive the poor woman into the woods?”
       exclaimed little Alice, who contrived to feel a human interest even in
      these discords of polemic divinity.

“They did, my darling,” replied Grandfather; “and the end of her life was
      so sad you must not hear it. At her departure, it appears, from the best
      authorities, that she gave the great Chair to her friend Henry Vane. He
      was a young man of wonderful talents and great learning, who had imbibed
      the religious opinions of the Puritans, and left England with the
      intention of spending his life in Massachusetts. The people chose him
      governor; but the controversy about Mrs. Hutchinson, and other troubles,
      caused him to leave country in 1637. You may read the subsequent events of
      his life in the History of England.”

“Yes, Grandfather,” cried Laurence; “and we may read them better in Mr.
      Upham’s biography of Vane. And what a beautiful death he died, long
      afterwards! beautiful, though it was on a scaffold.”

“Many of the most beautiful deaths have been there,” said Grandfather.
      “The enemies of a great and good man can in no other way make him so
      glorious as by giving him the crown of martyrdom.”

In order that the children might fully understand the all-important
      history of the chair, Grandfather now thought fit to speak of the progress
      that was made in settling several colonies. The settlement of Plymouth, in
      1620, has already been mentioned. In 1635 Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone, two
      ministers, went on foot from Massachusetts to Connecticut, through the
      pathless woods, taking their whole congregation along with them. They
      founded the town of Hartford. In 1638 Mr. Davenport, a very celebrated
      minister, went, with other people, and began a plantation at New Haven. In
      the same year, some persons who had been persecuted in Massachusetts went
      to the Isle of Rhodes, since called Rhode Island, and settled there. About
      this time, also, many settlers had gone to Maine, and were living without
      any regular government. There were likewise settlers near Piscataqua
      River, in the region which is now called New Hampshire.

Thus, at various points along the coast of New England, there were
      communities of Englishmen. Though these communities were independent of
      one another, yet they had a common dependence upon England; and, at so
      vast a distance from their native home, the inhabitants must all have felt
      like brethren. They were fitted to become one united People at a future
      period. Perhaps their feelings of brotherhood were the stronger because
      different nations had formed settlements to the north and to the south. In
      Canada and Nova Scotia were colonies of French. On the banks of the Hudson
      River was a colony of Dutch, who had taken possession of that region many
      years before, and called it New Netherlands.

Grandfather, for aught I know, might have gone on to speak of Maryland and
      Virginia; for the good old gentleman really seemed to suppose that the
      whole surface of the United States was not too broad a foundation to place
      the four legs of his chair upon. But, happening to glance at Charley, he
      perceived that this naughty boy was growing impatient and meditating
      another ride upon a stick. So here, for the present, Grandfather suspended
      the history of his chair.

The children had now learned to look upon the chair with an interest which
      was almost the same as if it were a conscious being, and could remember
      the many famous people whom it had held within its arms.

Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this venerable chair
      must not be clambered upon nor overturned, although he had no scruple in
      taking such liberties With every other chair in the house. Clara treated
      it with still greater reverence, often taking occasion to smooth its
      cushion, and to brush the dust from the carved flowers and grotesque
      figures of its oaken back and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole
      hour, especially at twilight, gazing at the chair, and, by the spell of
      his imaginations, summoning up its ancient occupants to appear in it
      again.

Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way; for once when
      Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard talking with the gentle
      Lady Arbella, as if she were still sitting in the chair. So sweet a child
      as little Alice may fitly talk with angels, such as the Lady Arbella had
      long since become.

Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the chair. He had
      no difficulty in relating them; for it really seemed as if every person
      noted in our early history had, on some occasion or other, found repose
      within its comfortable arms. If Grandfather took pride in anything, it was
      in being the possessor of such an honorable and historic elbow-chair.

“I know not precisely who next got possession of the chair after Governor
      Vane went back to England,” said Grandfather. “But there is reason to
      believe that President Dunster sat in it, when he held the first
      Commencement at Harvard College. You have often heard, children, how
      careful our forefathers were to give their young people a good education.
      They had scarcely cut down trees enough to make room for their own
      dwellings before they began to think of establishing a college. Their
      principal object was, to rear up pious and learned ministers; and hence
      old writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.”

“It is a long while since I took my degree, Charley. You must ask some of
      the recent graduates,” answered Grandfather. “As I was telling you,
      President Dunster sat in Grandfather’s chair in 1642, when he conferred
      the degree of bachelor of arts on nine young men. They were the first in
      America who had received that honor. And now, my dear auditors, I must
      confess that there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about
      the adventures of the chair for a period of almost ten years. Some say
      that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William Hawthorne, first
      speaker of the House of Representatives. I have nearly satisfied myself,
      however, that, during most of this questionable period, it was literally
      the chair of state. It gives me much pleasure to imagine that several
      successive governors of Massachusetts sat in it at the council board.”

“But, Grandfather,” interposed Charley, who was a matter-of-fact little
      person, “what reason have you, to imagine so?”

“With Charley’s permission, I will,” replied Grandfather, smiling. “Let us
      consider it settled, therefore, that Winthrop, Bellingham, Dudley, and
      Endicott, each of them, when chosen governor, took his seat in our great
      chair on election day. In this chair, likewise, did those excellent
      governors preside while holding consultations with the chief councillors
      of the province, who were styled assistants. The governor sat in this
      chair, too, whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of
      representatives.”

And here Grandfather took occasion to talk rather tediously about the
      nature and forms of government that established themselves, almost
      spontaneously, in Massachusetts and the other New England colonies.
      Democracies were the natural growth of the New World. As to Massachusetts,
      it was at first intended that the colony should be governed by a council
      in London. But in a little while the people had the whole power in their
      own hands, and chose annually the governor, the councillors, and the
      representatives. The people of Old England had never enjoyed anything like
      the liberties and privileges which the settlers of New England now
      possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of government after long
      study, but in simplicity, as if there were no other way for people to be
      ruled.

“But, Laurence,” continued Grandfather, “when you want instruction on
      these points, you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft’s History. I am merely
      telling the history of a chair. To proceed. The period during which the
      governors sat in our chair was not very full of striking incidents. The
      province was now established on a secure foundation; but it did not
      increase so rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer
      driven from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet and
      natural growth. The Legislature incorporated towns, and made new purchases
      of lands from the Indians. A very memorable event took place in 1643. The
      colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven formed a
      union, for the purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, for mutual
      defence against their enemies. They called themselves the United Colonies
      of New England.”

“No,” replied Grandfather; “the different colonies did not compose one
      nation together; it was merely a confederacy among the governments: It
      somewhat resembled the league of the Amphictyons, which you remember in
      Grecian history. But to return to our chair. In 1644 it was highly
      honored; for Governor Endicott sat in it when he gave audience to an
      ambassador from the French governor of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of
      peace between Massachusetts and the French colony was then signed.”

“Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace with foreign
      countries?” asked Laurence.

“Massachusetts and the whole of New England was then almost independent of
      the mother country,” said Grandfather. “There was now a civil war in
      England; and the king, as you may well suppose, had his hands full at
      home, and could pay but little attention to these remote colonies. When
      the Parliament got the power into their hands, they likewise had enough to
      do in keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like a young and hardy
      lad whose father and mother neglect it, was left to take care of itself.
      In 1649 King Charles was beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then became Protector
      of England; and as he was a Puritan himself, and had risen by the valor of
      the English Puritans, he showed himself a loving and indulgent father to
      the Puritan colonies in America.”

Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner nobody knows
      how long; but suspecting that Charley would find the subject rather dry,
      he looked sidewise at that vivacious little fellow, and saw him give an
      involuntary yawn. Whereupon Grandfather proceeded with the history of the
      chair, and related a very entertaining incident, which will be found in
      the next chapter.

“ACCORDING to the most authentic records, my dear children,” said
      Grandfather, “the chair, about this time, had the misfortune to break its
      leg. It was probably on account of this accident that it ceased to be the
      seat of the governors of Massachusetts; for, assuredly, it would have been
      ominous of evil to the commonwealth if the chair of state had tottered
      upon three legs. Being therefore sold at auction,—alas I what a
      vicissitude for a chair that had figured in such high company!—our
      venerable friend was knocked down to a certain Captain John Hull. This old
      gentleman, on carefully examining the maimed chair, discovered that its
      broken leg might be clamped with iron and made as serviceable as ever.”

“Here is the very leg that was broken!” exclaimed Charley, throwing
      himself down on the floor to look at it. “And here are the iron clamps.
      How well it was mended!”

When they had all sufficiently examined the broken leg, Grandfather told
      them a story about Captain John Hull and the Pine-tree Shillings.

The Captain John Hull aforesaid was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and
      coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line of business,
      for, in the earlier days of the colony, the current coinage consisted of
      gold and silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain. These coins being
      scarce, the people were often forced to barter their commodities instead
      of selling them.

For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged a
      bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, he might purchase
      it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets were used instead of
      farthings. The Indians had a sort of money, called wampum, which was made
      of clam-shells; and this strange sort of specie was likewise taken in
      payment of debts by the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard
      of. There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country,
      to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they sometimes had to take
      quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood, instead of silver or
      gold.

As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with another
      increased, the want of current money was still more sensibly felt. To
      supply the demand, the General Court passed a law for establishing a
      coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Captain John Hull was
      appointed to manufacture this money, and was to have about one shilling
      out of every twenty to pay him for the trouble of making them.

Hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to Captain John
      Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I suppose, and silver
      buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons of worn-out coats, and
      silver hilts of swords that had figured at court,—all such curious
      old articles were doubtless thrown into the melting-pot together. But by
      far the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines of
      South America, which the English buccaneers—who were little better
      than pirates—had taken from the Spaniards and brought to
      Massachusetts.

All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the result was
      an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Each
      had the date, 1652, on the one side, and the figure of a pine-tree on the
      other. Hence they were called pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty
      shillings that he coined, you will remember, Captain John Hull was
      entitled to put one shilling into his own pocket.

The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint master would have the
      best of the bargain. They offered him a large sum of money if he would but
      give up that twentieth shilling which he was continually dropping into his
      own pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the
      shilling. And well he might be; for so diligently did he labor, that, in a
      few years, his pockets, his money-bags, and his strong box were
      overflowing with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case when he
      came into possession of Grandfather’s chair; and, as he had worked so hard
      at the mint, it was certainly proper that he should have a comfortable
      chair to rest him self in.

When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, Samuel Sewall by
      name, came a-courting to his only daughter. His daughter—whose name
      I do not know, but we will call her Betsey—was a fine, hearty
      damsel, by no means so slender as some young ladies of our own days. On
      the contrary, having always fed heartily on pumpkin-pies, doughnuts,
      Indian puddings, and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as
      a pudding herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey did Samuel Sewall
      fall in love. As he was a young man of good character, industrious in his
      business, and a member of the church, the mint-master very readily gave
      his consent.

“Yes, you may take her,” said he, in his rough way, “and you’ll find her a
      heavy burden enough!”

On the wedding day, we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself
      in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree
      shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat were sixpences; and the knees of
      his small-clothes were buttoned with silver threepences. Thus attired, he
      sat with great dignity in Grandfather’s chair; and, being a portly old
      gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite
      side of the room, between her bride-maids, sat Miss Betsey. She was
      blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony, or a
      great red apple.

There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat and
      gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan laws and
      customs would allow him to put on. His hair was cropped close to his head,
      because Governor Endicott had forbidden any man to wear it below the ears.
      But he was a very personable young man; and so thought the bridemaids and
      Miss Betsey herself.

The mint-master also was pleased with his new Son-in-law; especially as he
      had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and had said nothing at all
      about her portion. So, when the marriage ceremony was over, Captain Hull
      whispered a word to two of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and
      soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as
      wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky
      commodity was now to be weighed in them.

Miss Betsey—or Mrs. Sewall, as we must now call her—did as she
      was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the why and
      wherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay
      for her by the pound (in which case she would have been a dear bargain),
      she had not the least idea.

The box to which the mint-master pointed was a huge, square, iron-bound,
      oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all four of you to play
      at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged with might and main, but could
      not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it
      across the floor. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked
      the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim
      of bright pine-tree shillings, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewall
      began to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money
      in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s honest
      share of the coinage.

Then the servants, at Captain Hull’s command, heaped double handfuls of
      shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsey remained in the other.
      Jingle, jingle, went the shillings, as handful after handful was thrown
      in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young
      lady from the floor.

“There, son Sewall!” cried the honest mint-master, resuming his seat in
      Grandfather’s chair, “take these shillings for my daughter’s portion. Use
      her kindly, and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that’s worth
      her weight in silver!”

The children laughed heartily at this legend, and would hardly be
      convinced but that Grandfather had made it out of his own head. He assured
      them faithfully, however, that he had found it in the pages of a grave
      historian, and had merely tried to tell it in a somewhat funnier style. As
      for Samuel Sewall, he afterwards became chief justice of Massachusetts.

“Well, Grandfather,” remarked Clara, “if wedding portions nowadays were
      paid as Miss Betsey’s was, young ladies would not pride themselves upon an
      airy figure, as many of them do.”

WHEN his little audience next assembled round the chair, Grandfather gave
      them a doleful history of the Quaker persecution, which began in 1656, and
      raged for about three years in Massachusetts.

He told them how, in the first place, twelve of the converts of George
      Fox, the first Quaker in the world, had come over from England. They
      seemed to be impelled by an earnest love for the souls of men, and a pure
      desire to make known what they considered a revelation from Heaven. But
      the rulers looked upon them as plotting the downfall of all government and
      religion. They were banished from the colony. In a little while, however,
      not only the first twelve had returned, but a multitude of other Quakers
      had come to rebuke the rulers and to preach against the priests and
      steeple-houses.

Grandfather described the hatred and scorn with which these enthusiasts
      were received. They were thrown into dungeons; they were beaten with many
      stripes, women as well as men; they were driven forth into the wilderness,
      and left to the tender mercies of tender mercies of wild beasts and
      Indians. The children were amazed hear that the more the Quakers were
      scourged, and imprisoned, and banished, the more did the sect increase,
      both by the influx of strangers and by converts from among the Puritans,
      But Grandfather told them that God had put something into the soul of man,
      which always turned the cruelties of the persecutor to naught.

He went on to relate that, in 1659, two Quakers, named William Robinson
      and Marmaduke Stephenson, were hanged at Boston. A woman had been
      sentenced to die with them, but was reprieved on condition of her leaving
      the colony. Her name was Mary Dyer. In the year 1660 she returned to
      Boston, although she knew death awaited her there; and, if Grandfather had
      been correctly informed, an incident had then taken place which connects
      her with our story. This Mary Dyer had entered the mint-master’s dwelling,
      clothed in sackcloth and ashes, and seated herself in our great chair with
      a sort of dignity and state. Then she proceeded to deliver what she called
      a message from Heaven, but in the midst of it they dragged her to prison.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, clinching his fist, “I would have fought for
      that poor Quaker woman!”

“Ah, but if a sword had been drawn for her,” said Laurence, “it would have
      taken away all the beauty of her death.”

It seemed as if hardly any of the preceding stories had thrown such an
      interest around Grandfather’s chair as did the fact that the poor,
      persecuted, wandering Quaker woman had rested in it for a moment. The
      children were so much excited that Grandfather found it necessary to bring
      his account of the persecution to a close.

“In 1660, the same year in which Mary Dyer was executed,” said he,
      “Charles II. was restored to the throne of his fathers. This king had many
      vices; but he would not permit blood to be shed, under pretence of
      religion, in any part of his dominions. The Quakers in England told him
      what had been done to their brethren in Massachusetts; and he sent orders
      to Governor Endicott to forbear all such proceedings in future. And so
      ended the Quaker persecution,—one of the most mournful passages in
      the history of our forefathers.”

Grandfather then told his auditors, that, shortly after the above
      incident, the great chair had been given by the mint-master to the Rev.
      Mr. John Eliot. He was the first minister of Roxbury. But besides
      attending to the pastoral duties there, he learned the language of the red
      men, and often went into the woods to preach to them. So earnestly did he
      labor for their conversion that he has always been called the apostle to
      the Indians. The mention of this holy man suggested to Grandfather the
      propriety of giving a brief sketch of the history of the Indians, so far
      as they were connected with the English colonists.

A short period before the arrival of the first Pilgrims at Plymouth there
      had been a very grievous plague among the red men; and the sages and
      ministers of that day were inclined to the opinion that Providence had
      sent this mortality in order to make room for the settlement of the
      English. But I know not why we should suppose that an Indian’s life is
      less precious, in the eye of Heaven, than that of a white man. Be that as
      it may, death had certainly been very busy with the savage tribes.

In many places the English found the wigwams deserted and the cornfields
      growing to waste, with none to harvest the grain. There were heaps of
      earth also, which, being dug open, proved to be Indian graves, containing
      bows and flint-headed spears and arrows; for the Indians buried the dead
      warrior’s weapons along with him. In some spots there were skulls and
      other human bones lying unburied. In 1633, and the year afterwards, the
      small-pox broke out among the Massachusetts Indians, multitudes of whom
      died by this terrible disease of the Old World. These misfortunes made
      them far less powerful than they had formerly been.

For nearly half a century after the arrival of the English the red men
      showed themselves generally inclined to peace and amity. They often made
      submission when they might have made successful war. The Plymouth
      settlers, led by the famous Captain Miles Standish, slew some of them, in
      1623, without any very evident necessity for so doing. In 1636, and the
      following year, there was the most dreadful war that had yet occurred
      between the Indians and the English. The Connecticut settlers, assisted by
      a celebrated Indian chief named Uncas, bore the brunt of this war, with
      but little aid from Massachusetts. Many hundreds of the hostile Indians
      were slain or burned in their wigwams. Sassacus, their sachem, fled to
      another tribe, after his own people were defeated; but he was murdered by
      them, and his head was sent to his English enemies.

From that period down to the time of King Philip’s War, which will be
      mentioned hereafter, there was not much trouble with the Indians. But the
      colonists were always on their guard, and kept their weapons ready for the
      conflict.

“I have sometimes doubted,” said Grandfather, when he had told these
      things to the Children,—“I have sometimes doubted whether there was
      more than a single man among our forefathers who realized that an Indian
      possesses a mind, and a heart, and an immortal soul. That single man was
      John Eliot. All the rest of the early settlers seemed to think that the
      Indians were an inferior race of beings, whom the Creator had merely
      allowed to keep possession of this beautiful country till the white men
      should be in want of it.”

“Did the pious men of those days never try to make Christian of them?”
       asked Laurence. “Sometimes, it is true,” answered Grandfather, “the
      magistrates and ministers would talk about civilizing and converting the
      red people. But, at the bottom of their hearts, they would have had almost
      as much expectation of civilizing the wild bear of the woods and making
      him fit for paradise. They felt no faith in the success of any such
      attempts, because they had no love for the poor Indians. Now, Eliot was
      full of love for them; and therefore so full of faith and hope that he
      spent the labor of a lifetime in their behalf.”

“Ah, Charley, there spoke the very spirit of our forefathers.” replied
      Grandfather. “But Mr. Eliot a better spirit. He looked upon them as his
      brethren. He persuaded as many of them as he could to leave off their idle
      and wandering habits, and to build houses and cultivate the earth, as the
      English did. He established schools among them and taught many of the
      Indians how to read. He taught them, likewise, how to pray. Hence they
      were called ‘praying Indians.’ Finally, having spent the best years of his
      life for their good, Mr. Eliot resolved to spend the remainder in doing
      them a yet greater benefit.”

“He sat down in his study,” continued Grandfather, “and began a
      translation of the Bible into the Indian tongue. It was while he was
      engaged in this pious work that the mint-master gave him our great chair.
      His toil needed it and deserved it.”

“O Grandfather, tell us all about that Indian Bible!” exclaimed Laurence.
      “I have seen it in the library of the Athenaeum; and the tears came into
      my eyes to think that there were no Indians left to read it.”

As Grandfather was a great admirer of the apostle Eliot, he was glad to
      comply with the earnest request which Laurence had made at the close of
      the last chapter. So he proceeded to describe how good Mr. Eliot labored,
      while he was at work upon the Indian Bible.

My dear children, what a task would you think it, even with a long
      lifetime before you, were you bidden to copy every chapter, and verse, and
      word, in yonder family Bible! Would not this be a heavy toil? But if the
      task were, not to write off the English Bible, but to learn a language
      utterly unlike all other tongues, a language which hitherto had never been
      learned, except by the Indians themselves, from their mothers’ lips,—a
      language never written, and the strange words of which seemed
      inexpressible by letters,—if the task were, first to learn this new
      variety of speech, and then to translate the Bible into it, and to do it
      so carefully that not one idea throughout the holy book should be changed,—what
      would induce you to undertake this toil? Yet this was what the apostle
      Eliot did.

It was a mighty work for a man, now growing old, to take upon himself. And
      what earthly reward could he expect from it? None; no reward on earth. But
      he believed that the red men were the descendants of those lost tribes of
      Israel of whom history has been able to tell us nothing for thousands of
      years. He hoped that God had sent the English across the ocean, Gentiles
      as they were, to enlighten this benighted portion of his once chosen race.
      And when he should be summoned hence, he trusted to meet blessed spirits
      in another world, whose bliss would have been earned by his patient toil
      in translating the word of God. This hope and trust were far dearer to him
      than anything that earth could offer.

Sometimes, while thus at work, he was visited by learned men, who desired
      to know what literary undertaking Mr. Eliot had in hand. They, like
      himself, had been bred in the studious cloisters of a university, and were
      supposed to possess all the erudition which mankind has hoarded up from
      age to age. Greek and Latin were as familiar to them as the bab-ble of
      their childhood. Hebrew was like their mother tongue. They had grown gray
      in study; their eyes were bleared with poring over print and manuscript by
      the light of the midnight lamp.

And yet, how much had they left unlearned! Mr. Eliot would put into their
      hands some of the pages which he had been writing; and behold! the
      gray-headed men stammered over the long, strange words, like a little
      child in his first attempts to read. Then would the apostle call to him an
      Indian boy, one of his scholars, and show him the manuscript which had so
      puzzled the learned Englishmen.

“Read this, my child,” would he say; “these are some brethren of mine, who
      would fain hear the sound of thy native tongue.”

Then would the Indian boy cast his eyes over the mysterious page, and read
      it so skilfully that it sounded like wild music. It seemed as if the
      forest leaves were singing in the ears of his auditors, and as the roar of
      distant streams were poured through the young Indian’s voice. Such were
      the sounds amid which the language of the red man had been formed; and
      they were still heard to echo in it.

The lesson being over, Mr. Eliot would give the Indian boy an apple or a
      cake, and bid him leap forth into the open air which his free nature
      loved. The Apostle was kind to children, and even shared in their sports
      sometimes. And when his visitors had bidden him farewell, the good man
      turned patiently to his toil again.

No other Englishman had ever understood the Indian character so well, nor
      possessed so great an influence over the New England tribes, as the
      apostle did. His advice and assistance must often have been valuable to
      his countrymen in their transactions with the Indians. Occasionally,
      perhaps, the governor and some of the councillors came to visit Mr. Eliot.
      Perchance they were seeking some method to circumvent the forest people.
      They inquired, it may be, how they could obtain possession of such and
      such a tract of their rich land. Or they talked of making the Indians
      their servants; as if God had destined them for perpetual bondage to the
      more powerful white man.

Perhaps, too, some warlike captain, dressed in his buff coat, with a
      corselet beneath it, accompanied the governor and councillors. Laying his
      hand upon his sword hilt, he would declare that the only method of dealing
      with the red men was to meet them with the sword drawn and the musket
      presented.

“Treat these sons of the forest as men and brethren,” he would say; “and
      let us endeavor to make them Christians. Their forefathers were of that
      chosen race whom God delivered from Egyptian bondage. Perchance he has
      destined us to deliver the children from the more cruel bondage of
      ignorance and idolatry. Chiefly for this end, it may be, we were directed
      across the ocean.”

When these other visitors were gone, Mr. Eliot bent himself again over the
      half-written page. He dared hardly relax a moment from his toil. He felt
      that, in the book which he was translating, there was a deep human as well
      as heavenly wisdom, which would of itself suffice to civilize and refine
      the savage tribes. Let the Bible be diffused among them, and all earthly
      good would follow. But how slight a consideration was this, when he
      reflected that the eternal welfare of a whole race of men depended upon
      his accomplishment of the task which he had set himself! What if his hands
      should be palsied? What if his mind should lose its vigor? What if death
      should come upon him ere the work were done? Then must the red man wander
      in the dark wilderness of heathenism forever.

Impelled by such thoughts as these, he sat writing in the great chair when
      the pleasant summer breeze came in through his open casement; and also
      when the fire of forest logs sent up its blaze and smoke, through the
      broad stone chimney, into the wintry air. Before the earliest bird sang in
      the morning the apostle’s lamp was kindled; and, at midnight, his weary
      head was not yet upon its pillow. And at length, leaning back in the great
      chair, he could say to himself, with a holy triumph, “The work is
      finished!”

It was finished. Here was a Bible for the Indians. Those long-lost
      descendants of the ten tribes of Israel would now learn the history of
      their forefathers. That grace which the ancient Israelites had forfeited
      was offered anew to their children.

There is no impiety in believing that, when his long life was over, the
      apostle of the Indians was welcomed to the celestial abodes by the
      prophets of ancient days and by those earliest apostles and evangelists
      who had drawn their inspiration from the immediate presence of the
      Saviour. They first had preached truth and salvation to the world. And
      Eliot, separated from them by many centuries, yet full of the same spirit,
      has borne the like message to the New World of the west. Since the first
      days of Christianity, there has been no man more worthy to be numbered in
      the brotherhood of the apostles than Eliot.

“My heart is not satisfied to think,” observed Laurence, “that Mr. Eliot’s
      labors have done no good except to a few Indians of his own time.
      Doubtless he would not have regretted his toil, if it were the means of
      saving but a single soul. But it is a grievous thing to me that he should
      have toiled so hard to translate the Bible, and now the language and the
      people are gone! The Indian Bible itself is almost the only relic of
      both.”

“Laurence,” said his Grandfather, “if ever you should doubt that man is
      capable of disinterested zeal for his brother’s good, then remember how
      the apostle Eliot toiled. And if you should feel your own self-interest
      pressing upon your heart too closely, then think of Eliot’s Indian Bible.
      It is good for the world that such a man has lived and left this emblem of
      his life.”

The tears gushed into the eyes of Laurence, and he acknowledged that Eliot
      had not toiled in vain. Little Alice put up her arms to Grandfather, and
      drew down his white head beside her own golden locks.

And, doubtless, good Mr. Eliot would gladly receive the kiss of so sweet a
      child as little Alice, and would think it a portion of his reward in
      heaven.

Grandfather now observed that Dr. Francis had written a very beautiful
      Life of Eliot, which he advised Laurence to peruse. He then spoke of King
      Philip’s War, which began in 1675, and terminated with the death of King
      Philip, in the following year. Philip was a proud, fierce Indian, whom Mr.
      Eliot had vainly endeavored to convert to the Christian faith.

“It must have been a great anguish to the apostle,” continued Grandfather,
      “to hear of mutual slaughter and outrage between his own countrymen and
      those for whom he felt the affection of a father. A few of the praying
      Indians joined the followers of King Philip. A greater number fought on
      the side of the English. In the course of the war the little community of
      red people whom Mr. Eliot had begun to civilize was scattered, and
      probably never was restored to a flourishing condition. But his zeal did
      not grow cold; and only about five years before his death he took great
      pains in preparing a new edition of the Indian Bible.”

“I do wish, Grandfather,” cried Charley, “you would tell us all about the
      battles in King Philip’s War.”

“No, Charley,” replied Grandfather, “I have no time to spare in talking
      about battles. You must be content with knowing that it was the bloodiest
      war that the Indians had ever waged against the white men; and that, at
      its close, the English set King Philip’s head upon a pole.”

“Their most noted captain was Benjamin Church, a very famous warrior,”
       said Grandfather. “But I assure you, Charley, that neither Captain Church,
      nor any of the officers and soldiers who fought in King Philip’s War, did
      anything a thousandth part so glorious as Mr. Eliot did when he translated
      the Bible for the Indians.”

The children were now accustomed to assemble round Grandfather’s chair at
      all their unoccupied moments; and often it was a striking picture to
      behold the white-headed old sire, with this flowery wreath of young people
      around him. When he talked to them, it was the past speaking to the
      present, or rather to the future,—for the children were of a
      generation which had not become actual. Their part in life, thus far, was
      only to be happy and to draw knowledge from a thousand sources. As yet, it
      was not their time to do.

Sometimes, as Grandfather gazed at their fair, unworldly countenances, a
      mist of tears bedimmed his spectacles. He almost regretted that it was
      necessary for them to know anything of the past or to provide aught for
      the future. He could have wished that they might be always the happy,
      youthful creatures who had hitherto sported around his chair, without
      inquiring whether it had a history. It grieved him to think that his
      little Alice, who was a flower bud fresh from paradise, must open her
      leaves to the rough breezes of the world, or ever open them in any clime.
      So sweet a child she was, that it seemed fit her infancy should be
      immortal.

But such repinings were merely flitting shadows across the old man’s
      heart. He had faith enough to believe, and wisdom enough to know, that the
      bloom of the flower would be even holier and happier than its bud. Even
      within himself, though Grandfather was now at that period of life when the
      veil of mortality is apt to hang heavily over the soul, still, in his
      inmost being he was conscious of something that he would not have
      exchanged for the best happiness of childhood. It was a bliss to which
      every sort of earthly experience—all that he had enjoyed, or
      suffered or seen, or heard, or acted, with the broodings of his soul upon
      the whole—had contributed somewhat. In the same manner must a bliss,
      of which now they could have no conception, grow up within these children,
      and form a part of their sustenance for immortality.

So Grandfather, with renewed cheerfulness, continued his history of the
      chair, trusting that a profounder wisdom than his own would extract, from
      these flowers and weeds of Time, a fragrance that might last beyond all
      time.

At this period of the story Grandfather threw a glance backward as far as
      the year 1660. He spoke of the ill-concealed reluctance with which the
      Puritans in America had acknowledged the sway of Charles II. on his
      restoration to his father’s throne. When death had stricken Oliver
      Cromwell, that mighty protector had no sincerer mourners than in New
      England. The new king had been more than a year upon the throne before his
      accession was proclaimed in Boston, although the neglect to perform the
      ceremony might have subjected the rulers to the charge of treason.

During the reign of Charles II., however, the American colonies had but
      little reason to complain of harsh or tyrannical treatment. But when
      Charles died, in 1685, and was succeeded by his brother James, the
      patriarchs of New England began to tremble. King James was known to be of
      an arbitrary temper. It was feared by the Puritans that he would assume
      despotic power. Our forefathers felt that they had no security either for
      their religion or their liberties.

The result proved that they had reason for their apprehensions. King James
      caused the charters of all the American colonies to be taken away. The old
      charter of Massachusetts, which the people regarded as a holy thing and as
      the foundation of all their liberties, was declared void. The colonists
      were now no longer freemen; they were entirely dependent on the king’s
      pleasure. At first, in 1685, King James appointed Joseph Dudley, a native
      of Massachusetts, to be president of New England. But soon afterwards, Sir
      Edmund Andros, an officer of the English army, arrived, with a commission
      to be governor-general of New England and New York.

The king had given such powers to Sir Edmund Andros that there was now no
      liberty, nor scarcely any law, in the colonies over which he ruled. The
      inhabitants were not allowed to choose representatives, and consequently
      had no voice whatever in the government, nor control over the measures
      that were adopted. The councillors with whom the governor consulted on
      matters of state were appointed by himself. This sort of government was no
      better than an absolute despotism.

“The people suffered much wrong while Sir Edmund Andros ruled over them,”
       continued Grandfather; “and they were apprehensive of much more. He had
      brought some soldiers with him from England, who took possession of the
      old fortress on Castle Island and of the fortification on Fort Hill.
      Sometimes it was rumored that a general massacre of the inhabitants was to
      be perpetrated by these soldiers. There were reports, too, that all the
      ministers were to be slain or imprisoned.”

“Because they were the leaders of the people, Charley,” said Grandfather.
      “A minister was a more formidable man than a general, in those days. Well,
      while these things were going on in America, King James had so misgoverned
      the people of England that they sent over to Holland for the Prince of
      Orange. He had married the king’s daughter, and was therefore considered
      to have a claim to the crown. On his arrival in England, the Prince of
      Orange was proclaimed king, by the name of William III. Poor old King
      James made his escape to France.”

Grandfather told how, at the first intelligence of the landing of the
      Prince of Orange in England, the people of Massachusetts rose in their
      strength and overthrew the government of Sir Edmund Andros. He, with
      Joseph Dudley, Edmund Randolph, and his other principal adherents, was
      thrown into prison. Old Simon Bradstreet, who had been governor when King
      James took away the charter, was called by the people to govern them
      again.

“Governor Bradstreet was a venerable old man, nearly ninety years of age,”
       said Grandfather. “He came over with the first settlers, and had been the
      intimate companion of all those excellent and famous men who laid the
      foundation of our country. They were all gone before him to the grave, and
      Bradstreet was the last of the Puritans.”

Grandfather paused a moment and smiled, as if he had something very
      interesting to tell his auditors. He then proceeded:—

“And now, Laurence,—now, Clara,—now, Charley,—now, my
      dear little Alice,—what chair do you think had been placed in the
      council chamber, for old Governor Bradstreet to take his seat in? Would
      you believe that it was this very chair in which Grandfather now sits, and
      of which he is telling you the history?”

“I am glad to hear it, with all my heart!” cried Charley, after a shout of
      delight. “I thought Grandfather had quite forgotten the chair.”

“It was a solemn and affecting sight,” said Grandfather, “when this
      venerable patriarch, with his white beard flowing down upon his breast,
      took his seat in his chair of state. Within his remembrance, and even
      since his mature age, the site where now stood the populous town had been
      a wild and forest-covered peninsula. The province, now so fertile and
      spotted with thriving villages, had been a desert wilderness. He was
      surrounded by a shouting multitude, most of whom had been born in the
      country which he had helped to found. They were of one generation, and he
      of another. As the old man looked upon them, and beheld new faces
      everywhere, he must have felt that it was now time for him to go whither
      his brethren had gone before him.”

“All of them,” replied Grandfather. “Winthrop had been dead forty years.
      Endicott died, a very old man, in 1665. Sir Henry Vane was beheaded, in
      London, at the beginning of the reign of Charles II. And Haynes, Dudley,
      Bellingham, and Leverett, who had all been governors of Massachusetts,
      were now likewise in their graves. Old Simon Bradstreet was the sole
      representative of that departed brotherhood. There was no other public man
      remaining to connect the ancient system of government and manners with the
      new system which was about to take its place. The era of the Puritans was
      now completed.”

“I am sorry for it!” observed Laurence; “for though they were so stern,
      yet it seems to me that there was something warm and real about them. I
      think, Grandfather, that each of these old governors should have his
      statue set up in our State House, Sculptured out of the hardest of New
      England granite.”

“It would not be amiss, Laurence,” said Grandfather; “but perhaps clay, or
      some other perishable material, might suffice for some of their
      successors. But let us go back to our chair. It was occupied by Governor
      Bradstreet from April, 1689, until May, 1692. Sir William Phips then
      arrived in Boston with a new charter from King William and a commission to
      be governor.”

“AND what became of the chair?” inquired Clara, “The outward aspect of our
      chair,” replied Grandfather, “was now somewhat the worse for its long and
      arduous services. It was considered hardly magnificent enough to be
      allowed to keep its place in the council chamber of Massachusetts. In
      fact, it was banished as an article of useless lumber. But Sir William
      Phips happened to see it, and, being much pleased with its construction,
      resolved to take the good old chair into his private mansion. Accordingly,
      with his own gubernatorial hands, he repaired one of its arms, which had
      been slightly damaged.”

“Why, Grandfather, here is the very arm!” interrupted Charley, in great
      wonderment. “And did Sir William Phips put in these screws with his own
      hands? I am sure he did it beautifully! But how came a governor to know
      how to mend a chair?”

“I will tell you a story about the early life of Sir William Phips,” said
      Grandfather. “You will then perceive that he well knew how to use his
      hands.”

Picture to yourselves, my dear children, a handsome, old-fashioned room,
      with a large, open cupboard at one end, in which is displayed a
      magnificent gold cup, with some other splendid articles of gold and silver
      plate. In another part of the room, opposite to a tall looking-glass,
      stands our beloved chair, newly polished, and adorned with a gorgeous
      cushion of crimson velvet tufted with gold.

In the chair sits a man of strong and sturdy frame, whose face has been
      roughened by northern tempests and blackened by the burning sun of the
      West Indies. He wears an immense periwig, flowing down over his shoulders.
      His coat has a wide embroidery of golden foliage; and his waistcoat,
      likewise, is all flowered over and bedizened with gold. His red, rough
      hands, which have done many a good day’s work with the hammer and adze,
      are half covered by the delicate lace ruffles at his wrists. On a table
      lies his silver-hilted sword; and in a corner of the room stands his
      gold-headed cane, made of a beautifully polished West India wood.

Somewhat such an aspect as this did Sir William Phips present when he sat
      in Grandfather’s chair after the king had appointed him governor of
      Massachusetts. Truly there was need that the old chair should be varnished
      and decorated with a crimson cushion, in order to make it suitable for
      such a magnificent-looking personage.

But Sir William Phips had not always worn a gold-embroidered coat, nor
      always sat so much at his ease as he did in Grandfather’s chair. He was a
      poor man’s son, and was born in the province of Maine, where he used to
      tend sheep upon the hills in his boyhood and youth. Until he had grown to
      be a man, he did not even know how to read and write. Tired of tending
      sheep, he next apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter, and spent about
      four years in hewing the crooked limbs of oak-trees into knees for
      vessels.

In 1673, when he was twenty-two years old, he came to Boston, and soon
      afterwards was married to a widow lady, who had property enough to set him
      up in business. It was not long, however, before he lost all the money
      that he had acquired by his marriage, and became a poor man again. Still
      he was not discouraged. He often told his wife that, some time or other,
      he should be very rich, and would build a “fair brick house” in the Green
      Lane of Boston.

Do not suppose, children, that he had been to a fortune-teller to inquire
      his destiny. It was his own energy and spirit of enterprise, and his
      resolution to lead an industrious life, that made him look forward with so
      much confidence to better days.

Several years passed away, and William Phips had not yet gained the riches
      which he promised to himself. During this time he had begun to follow the
      sea for a living. In the year 1684 he happened to hear of a Spanish ship
      which had been cast away near the Bahama Islands, and which was supposed
      to contain a great deal of gold and silver. Phips went to the place in a
      small vessel, hoping that he should be able to recover some of the
      treasure from the wreck. He did not succeed, however, in fishing up gold
      and silver enough to pay the expenses of his voyage.

But, before he returned, he was told of another Spanish ship, or galleon,
      which had been east away near Porto de la Plata. She had now lain as much
      as fifty years beneath the waves. This old ship had been laden with
      immense wealth; and, hitherto, nobody had thought of the possibility of
      recovering any part of it from the deep sea which was rolling and tossing
      it about. But though it was now an old story, and the most aged people had
      almost forgotten that such a vessel had been wrecked, William Phips
      resolved that the sunken treasure should again be brought to light.

He went to London and obtained admittance to King James, who had not yet
      been driven from his throne. He told the king of the vast wealth that was
      lying at the bottom of the sea. King James listened with attention, and
      thought this a fine opportunity to fill his treasury with Spanish gold. He
      appointed William Phips to be captain of a vessel, called the Rose Algier,
      carrying eighteen guns and ninety-five men. So now he was Captain Phips of
      the English navy.

Captain Phips sailed from England in the Rose Algier, and cruised for
      nearly two years in the West Indies, endeavoring to find the wreck of the
      Spanish ship. But the sea is so wide and deep that it is no easy matter to
      discover the exact spot where a sunken vessel lies. The prospect of
      success seemed very small; and most people would have thought that Captain
      Phips was as far from having money enough to build a “fair brick house” as
      he was while he tended sheep.

The seamen of the Rose Algier became discouraged, and gave up all hope of
      making their fortunes by discovering the Spanish wreck. They wanted to
      compel Captain Phips to turn pirate. There was a much better prospect,
      they thought, of growing rich by plundering vessels which still sailed in
      the sea than by seeking for a ship that had lain beneath the waves full
      half a century. They broke out in open mutiny; but were finally mastered
      by Phips, and compelled to obey his orders. It would have been dangerous,
      however, to continue much longer at sea with such a crew of mutinous
      sailors; and, besides, the Rose Algier was leaky and unseaworthy. So
      Captain Phips judged it best to return to England.

Before leaving the West Indies, he met with a Spaniard, an old man, who
      remembered the wreck of the Spanish ship, and gave him directions how to
      find the very spot. It was on a reef of rocks, a few leagues from Porto de
      la Plata.

On his arrival in England, therefore, Captain Phips solicited the king to
      let him have another vessel and send him back again to the West Indies.
      But King James, who had probably expected that the Rose Algier would
      return laden with gold, refused to have anything more to do with the
      affair. Phips might never have been able to renew the search if the Duke
      of Albemarle and some other noblemen had not lent their assistance. They
      fitted out a ship, and gave the command to Captain Phips. He sailed from
      England, and arrived safely at Porto de la Plata, where he took an adze
      and assisted his men to build a large boat.

The boat was intended for the purpose of going closer to the reef of rocks
      than a large vessel could safely venture. When it was finished, the
      captain sent several men in it to examine the spot where the Spanish ship
      was said to have been wrecked. They were accompanied by some Indians, who
      were skilful divers, and could go down a great way into the depths of the
      sea.

The boat’s crew proceeded to the reef of rocks, and rowed round and round
      it a great many times. They gazed down into the water, which was so
      transparent that it seemed as if they could have seen the gold and silver
      at the bottom, had there been any of those precious metals there. Nothing,
      however, could they see, nothing more valuable than a curious sea shrub,
      which was growing beneath the water, in a crevice of the reef of rocks. It
      flaunted to and fro with the swell and reflux of the waves, and looked as
      bright and beautiful as if its leaves were gold.

“We won’t go back empty-handed,” cried an English sailor; and then he
      spoke to one of the Indian divers. “Dive down and bring me that pretty sea
      shrub there. That’s the only treasure we shall find.”

Down plunged the diver, and soon rose dripping from the water, holding the
      sea shrub in his hand. But he had learned some news at the bottom of the
      sea.

“There are some ship’s guns,” said he, the moment he had drawn breath,
      “some great cannon, among the rocks, near where the shrub was growing.”

No sooner had he spoken than the English sailors knew that they had found
      the very spot where the Spanish galleon had been wrecked, so many years
      before. The other Indian divers immediately plunged over the boat’s side
      and swam headlong down, groping among the rocks and sunken cannon. In a
      few moments one of them rose above the water with a heavy lump of silver
      in his arms. The single lump was worth more than a thousand dollars. The
      sailors took it into the boat, and then rowed back as speedily as they
      could, being in haste to inform Captain Phips of their good luck.

But, confidently as the captain had hoped to find the Spanish wreck, yet,
      now that it was really found, the news seemed too good to be true. He
      could not believe it till the sailors showed him the lump of silver.

Hereupon the captain and all the crew set to work, with iron rakes and
      great hooks and lines, fishing for gold and silver at the bottom of the
      sea. Up came the treasure in abundance. Now they beheld a table of solid
      silver, once the property of an old Spanish grandee. Now they found a
      sacramental vessel, which had been destined as a gift to some Catholic
      church. Now they drew up a golden cup, fit for the King of Spain to drink
      his wine out of. Perhaps the bony hand of its former owner had been
      grasping the precious cup, and was drawn up along with it. Now their rakes
      or fishing-lines were loaded with masses of silver bullion. There were
      also precious stones among the treasure, glittering and sparkling, so that
      it is a wonder how their radiance could have been concealed.

There is something sad and terrible in the idea of snatching all this
      wealth from the devouring ocean, which had possessed it for such a length
      of years. It seems as if men had no right to make themselves rich with it.
      It ought to have been left with the skeletons of the ancient Spaniards,
      who had been drowned when the ship was wrecked, and whose bones were now
      scattered among the gold and silver.

But Captain Phips and his crew were troubled with no such thoughts as
      these. After a day or two they lighted on another part of the wreck, where
      they found a great many bags of silver dollars. But nobody could have
      guessed that these were money-bags. By remaining so long in the salt
      water, they had become covered over with a crust which had the appearance
      of stone, so that it was necessary to break them in pieces with hammers
      and axes. When this was done, a stream of silver dollars gushed out upon
      the deck of the vessel.

The whole value of the recovered treasure, plate, bullion, precious
      stones, and all, was estimated at more than two millions of dollars. It
      was dangerous even to look at such a vast amount of wealth. A sea-captain,
      who had assisted Phips in the enterprise, utterly lost his reason at the
      sight of it. He died two years afterwards, still raving about the
      treasures that lie at the bottom of the sea. It would have been better for
      this man if he had left the skeletons of the shipwrecked Spaniards in
      quiet possession of their wealth.

Captain Phips and his men continued to fish up plate, bullion, and
      dollars, as plentifully as ever, till their provisions grew short. Then,
      as they could not feed upon gold and silver any more than old King Midas
      could, they found it necessary to go in search of better sustenance. Phips
      resolved to return to England. He arrived there in 1687, and was received
      with great joy by the Duke of Albemarle and other English lords who had
      fitted out the vessel. Well they might rejoice; for they took by far the
      greater part of the treasure to themselves.

The captain’s share, however, was enough to make him comfortable for the
      rest of his days. It also enabled him to fulfil his promise to his wife,
      by building a “fair brick house” in the Green Lane of Boston. The Duke of
      Albemarle sent Mrs. Phips a magnificent gold cup, worth at least five
      thousand dollars. Before Captain Phips left London, King James made him a
      knight; so that, instead of the obscure ship-carpenter who had formerly
      dwelt among them, the inhabitants of Boston welcomed him on his return as
      the rich and famous Sir William Phips.

“Sir William Phips,” continued Grandfather, “was too active and
      adventurous a man to sit still in the quiet enjoyment of his good fortune.
      In the year 1690 he went on a military expedition against the French
      colonies in America, conquered the whole province of Acadia, and returned
      to Boston with a great deal of plunder.”

“Ask Laurence what he thinks,” replied Grandfather, with a smile. “Well,
      in the same year, Sir William took command of an expedition against
      Que-bec, but did not succeed in capturing the city. In 1692, being then in
      London, King William III. appointed him governor of Massachusetts. And
      now, my dear children, having followed Sir William Phips through all his
      adventures and hardships till we find him comfortably seated in
      Grandfather’s chair, we will here bid him farewell. May he be as happy in
      ruling a people as he was while he tended sheep!”

Charley, whose fancy had been greatly taken by the adventurous disposition
      of Sir William Phips, was eager to know how he had acted and what happened
      to him while he held the office of governor. But Grandfather had made up
      his mind to tell no more stories for the present.

“Possibly, one of these days, I may go on with the adventures of the
      chair,” said he. “But its history becomes very obscure just at this point;
      and I must search into some old books and manuscripts before proceeding
      further. Besides, it is now a good time to pause in our narrative; because
      the new charter, which Sir William Phips brought over from England, formed
      a very important epoch in the history of the province.”

“Really, Grandfather,” observed Laurence, “this seems to be the most
      remarkable chair, in the world. Its history cannot be told without
      intertwining it with the lives of distinguished men and the great events
      that have befallen the country.”

“True, Laurence,’” replied Grandfather, smiling; “we must write a book
      with some such title as this: MEMOIRS OF MY OWN TIMES, BY GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR.”

“But, after all,” continued Grandfather, “any other old chair, if it
      possessed memory and a hand to write its recollections, could record
      stranger stories than any that I have told you. From generation to
      generation, a chair sits familiarly in the midst of human interests, and
      is witness to the most secret and confidential intercourse that mortal man
      can hold with his fellow. The human heart may best be read in the fireside
      chair. And as to external events, Grief and Joy keep a continual
      vicissitude around it and within it. Now we see the glad face and glowing
      form of Joy, sitting merrily in the old chair, and throwing a warm
      firelight radiance over all the household. Now, while we thought not of
      it, the dark-clad mourner, Grief, has stolen into the place of Joy, but
      not to retain it long. The imagination can hardly grasp so wide a subject
      as is embraced in the experience of a family chair.”

“It makes my breath flutter, my heart thrill, to think of it,” said
      Laurence. “Yes, a family chair must have a deeper history than a chair of
      state.”

“Oh yes!” cried Clara, expressing a woman’s feeling of the point in
      question; “the history of a country is not nearly so interesting as that
      of a single family would be.”

“But the history of a country is more easily told,” said Grandfather. “So,
      if we proceed with our narrative of the chair, I shall still confine
      myself to its connection with public events.”

Good old Grandfather now rose and quitted the room, while the children
      remained gazing at the chair. Laurence, so vivid was his conception of
      past times, would hardly have deemed it strange if its former occupants,
      one after another, had resumed the seat which they had each left vacant
      such a dim length of years ago.

First, the gentle and lovely Lady Arbella would have been seen in the old
      chair, almost sinking out of its arms for very weakness; then Roger
      Williams, in his cloak and band, earnest, energetic, and benevolent; then
      the figure of Anne Hutchinson, with the like gesture as when she presided
      at the assemblages of women; then the dark, intellectual face of Vane,
      “young in years, but in sage counsel old.” Next would have appeared the
      successive governors, Winthrop, Dudley, Bellingham, and Endicott, who sat
      in the chair while it was a chair of state. Then its ample seat would have
      been pressed by the comfortable, rotund corporation of the honest
      mint-master. Then the half-frenzied shape of Mary Dyer, the persecuted
      Quaker woman, clad in sackcloth and ashes would have rested in it for a
      moment. Then the holy, apostolic form of Eliot would have sanctified it.
      Then would have arisen, like the shade of departed Puritanism, the
      venerable dignity of the white-bearded Governor Bradstreet. Lastly, on the
      gorgeous crimson cushion of Grandfather’s chair would have shone the
      purple and golden magnificence of Sir William Phips. But all these, with
      the other historic personages, in the midst of whom the chair had so often
      stood, had passed, both in substance and shadow, from the scene of ages.
      Yet here stood the chair, with the old Lincoln coat of arms, and the oaken
      flowers and foliage, and the fierce lion’s head at the summit, the whole,
      apparently, in as perfect preservation as when it had first been placed in
      the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. And what vast changes of society and of
      nations had been wrought by sudden convulsions or by slow degrees since
      that era!

“This Chair had stood firm when the thrones of kings were overturned!”
       thought Laurence. “Its oaken frame has proved stronger than many frames of
      government!”

More the thoughtful and imaginative boy might have mused; but now a large
      yellow cat, a great favorite with all the children, leaped in at the open
      window. Perceiving that Grandfather’s chair was empty, and having often
      before experienced its comforts, puss laid herself quietly down upon the
      cushion. Laurence, Clara, Charley, and little Alice all laughed at the
      idea of such a successor to the worthies of old times.

“Pussy,” said little Alice, putting out her hand, into which the cat laid
      a velvet paw, “you look very wise. Do tell us a story about GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR!”

MR. ELIOT had been for some time assiduously employed in learning the
      Indian language. To accomplish this, he secured the assistance of one of
      the natives, who could speak English. Eliot, at the close of his Indian
      Grammar, mentions him as “a pregnant-witted young man, who had been a
      servant in an English house, who pretty well understood his own language,
      and had a clear pronunciation.” He took this Indian into his family, and
      by constant intercourse with him soon become sufficiently conversant with
      the vocabulary and construction of the language to translate the ten
      commandments, the Lord’s prayer, and several passages of Scripture,
      besides composing exhortations and prayers.

Mr. Eliot must have found his task anything but easy or inviting. He was
      to learn a dialect, in which he could be assisted by no affinity with the
      languages he already knew. He was to do this without the help of any
      written or printed specimens, with nothing in the shape of a grammar or
      analysis, but merely by oral communication with his Indian instructor, or
      with other natives, who, however comparatively intelligent, must from the
      nature of the case have been very imperfect teachers. He applied himself
      to the work with great patience and sagacity, carefully acting the
      differences between the Indian and the English modes of constructing
      words; and, having once got a clew to this, he pursued every noun and verb
      he could think of through all possible variations. In this way he arrived
      at analyses and rules, which he could apply for himself in a general
      manner.

Neal says that Eliot was able to speak the language intelligibly after
      conversing with the Indian servant a few months. This, in a limited sense,
      may be true; but he is said to have been engaged two years in the process
      of learning, before he went to preached to the Indians. In that time he
      acquired a somewhat ready facility in the use of that dialect, by means of
      which he was to carry the instructions of spiritual truth to the men of
      the forest, though as late as 1649 he still lamented his want of skill in
      this respect.

Notice having been given of his intention [of instructing the Indians],
      Mr. Eliot, in company with three others, whose names are not mentioned,
      having implored the divine blessing on the undertaking, made his first
      visit to the Indians on the 28th of October, 1646 at a place afterwards
      called Nonantum; a spot that has the honor of being the first on which a
      civilized and Christian settlement of Indians was effected within the
      English colonies of North America. This name was given to the high grounds
      in the north, east part of Newton, and to the bounds of that town and
      Watertown. At a short distance from the wigwams, they were met by Waban, a
      leading man among the Indians at that place, accompanied by others, and
      were welcomed with “English salutations.” Waban, who is described as “the
      chief minister of justice among them,” had before shown a better
      disposition than any other native to receive the religious instruction of
      the Christians, and had voluntarily proposed to have his eldest son
      educated by them. His son had been accordingly placed at school in Dedham,
      whence he had now come to attend the meeting.

The Indians assembled in Waban’s wigwam; and thither Mr. Eliot and his
      friends were conducted. When the company were all collected and quiet, a
      religious service was begun with prayer. This was uttered in English; the
      reason for which, as given by Mr. Eliot and his companions, was, that he
      did not then feel sufficiently acquainted with the Indian language to use
      it in that service.

The same difficulty would not occur in preaching, since for this, we may
      suppose, he had sufficiently prepared his thoughts and expressions to make
      his discourse intelligible on all important points; and if he should, in
      some parts, fail of being, understood, he could repeat or correct himself,
      till he should succeed better. Besides, he took with him an interpretor,
      who was frequently able to express his instructions more distinctly than
      he could himself. Though the prayer was unintelligible to the Indians,
      yet, as they knew what the nature of the service was, Mr. Eliot believed
      it might not be without an effect in subduing their feelings so as to
      prepare them better to listen to the preaching.

Mr. Eliot then began his sermon, or address, from Ezek. xxxvii. 9, 10. The
      word wind, in this passage, suggested to the minds of some, who afterwards
      gave an account of this meeting, a coincidence which might, in the spirit
      of the times, be construed into a special appointment of Providence. The
      name of Waban signified, in the Indian tongue, wind; so that when the
      preacher uttered the words, “say to the wind,” it was as if he had
      proclaimed, “say to Waban.” As this man afterwards exerted much influence
      in awaking the attention of his fellow savages to Christianity, it might
      seem that in this first visit of the messengers of the gospel he was
      singled out by a special call to work in the cause. It is not surprising
      that the Indians were struck with the coincidence. Mr. Eliot gave no
      countenance to a superstitious use of the circumstance, and took care to
      tell them that, when he chose his text, he had no thought of any such
      application.

The sermon was an hour and a quarter long. One cannot but suspect that Mr.
      Eliot injudiciously crowded too much into one address. It would seem to
      have been better, for the first time at least, to have given a shorter
      sermon, and to have touched upon fewer subjects. But he was doubtless
      borne on by his zeal to do much in a good cause; and, as we have reason to
      think, by the attentive, though vague, curiosity of the Indians.

Thus ended a conference three hours long, at the end of which the Indians
      affirmed that they were not weary, and requested their visitors to come
      again. They expressed a wish to build a town and live together. Mr. Eliot
      promised to intercede for them with the court. He and his companions then
      gave the men some tobacco, and the children some apples, and bade them
      farewell.

A fortnight afterwards, on the 11th of November, Mr. Eliot and his friends
      repeated their visit to the wigwam of Waban. This meeting was more
      numerous than the former. The religious service was opened, as before,
      with a prayer in English. This was followed by a few brief and plain
      questions addressed to the children, admitting short and easy answers. The
      children seemed well disposed to listen and learn. To encourage them, Mr.
      Eliot gave them occasionally an apple or a cake; and the adults were
      requested to repeat to them the instructions that had been given. He then
      preached to the assembly in their own language, telling them that he had
      come to bring them good news from God, and show them how wicked men might
      become good and happy; and, in general, discoursing on nearly the same
      topics as he had treated at his first visit.

“O GRANDFATHER, dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, “pray tell us some
      more stories about your chair!”

How long a time had fled since the children bad felt any curiosity to hear
      the sequel of this venerable chair’s adventures! Summer was now past and
      gone, and the better part of autumn likewise. Dreary, chill November was
      howling out of doors, and vexing the atmosphere with sudden showers of
      wintry rain, or sometimes with gusts of snow, that rattled like small
      pebbles against the windows.

When the weather began to grow cool, Grandfather’s chair had been removed
      from the summer parlor into a smaller and snugger room. It now stood by
      the side of a bright, blazing wood-fire. Grandfather loved a wood-fire far
      better than a grate of glowing anthracite, or than the dull heat of an
      invisible furnace, which seems to think that it has done its duty in
      merely warming the house. But the wood-fire is a kindly, cheerful,
      sociable spirit, sympathizing with mankind, and knowing that to create
      warmth is but one of the good offices which are expected from it.
      Therefore it dances on the hearth, and laughs broadly throughout the room,
      and plays a thousand antics, and throws a joyous glow over all the faces
      that encircle it.

In the twilight of the evening the fire grew brighter and more cheerful.
      And thus, perhaps, there was something in Grandfather’s heart that cheered
      him most with its warmth and comfort in the gathering twilight of old age.
      He had been gazing at the red embers as intently as if his past life were
      all pictured there, or as if it were a prospect of the future world, when
      little Alice’s voice aroused him. “Dear Grandfather,” repeated the little
      girl, more earnestly, “do talk to us again about your chair.”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley, and little Alice had been attracted to
      other objects for two or three months past. They had sported in the
      gladsome sunshine of the present, and so had forgotten the shadowy region
      of the past, in the midst of which stood Grandfather’s chair. But now, in
      the autumnal twilight, illuminated by the flickering blaze of the
      wood-fire, they looked at the old chair, and thought that it had never
      before worn such an interesting aspect. There it stood in the venerable
      majesty of more than two hundred years. The light from the hearth quivered
      upon the flowers and foliage that were wrought into its oaken back; and
      the lion’s head at the summit seemed almost to move its jaws and shake its
      mane.

“Does little Alice speak for all of you?” asked Grandfather. “Do you wish
      me to go on with the adventures of the chair?’

“Oh yes, yes, Grandfather!” cried Clara. “The dear old chair! How strange
      that we should have forgotten it so long!”

“Oh, pray begin, Grandfather,” said Laurence, “for I think, when we talk
      about old times, it should be in the early evening, before the candles are
      lighted. The shapes of the famous persons who once sat in the chair will
      be more apt to come back, and be seen among us, in this glimmer and
      pleasant gloom, than they would in the vulgar daylight. And, besides, we
      can make pictures of all that you tell us among the glowing embers and
      white ashes.”

Our friend Charley, too, thought the evening the best time to hear
      Grandfather’s stories, because he could not then be playing out of doors.
      So finding his young auditors unanimous in their petition, the good old
      gentleman took up the narrative of the historic chair at the point where
      he had dropped it.

“You recollect, my dear children,” said Grandfather, “that we took leave
      of the chair in 1692, while it was occupied by Sir William Phips. This
      fortunate treasure-seeker, you will remember, had come over from England,
      with King William’s commission, to be governor of Massachusetts. Within
      the limits of this province were now included the old colony of Plymouth,
      and the territories of Maine and Nova Scotia. Sir William Phips had
      likewise brought a new charter from the king, which served instead of a
      constitution, and set forth the method in which the province was to be
      governed.”

“No,” replied Grandfather. “Under the first charter, the people had been
      the source of all power. Winthrop, Endicott, Bradstreet, and the rest of
      them had been governors by the choice of the people, without any
      interference of the king. But henceforth the governor was to hold his
      station solely by the king’s appointment and during his pleasure; and the
      same was the case with the lieutenant-governor and some other high
      officers. The people, however, were still allowed to choose
      representatives; and the governor’s council was chosen by the General
      Court.”

“Would the inhabitants have elected Sir William Phips,” asked Laurence,
      “if the choice of governor had been left to them?”

“He might probably have been a successful candidate,” answered
      Grandfather; “for his adventures and military enterprises had gained him a
      sort of renown, which always goes a great way with the people. And he had
      many popular characteristics,—being a kind warm-hearted man, not
      ashamed of his low origin nor haughty in his present elevation. Soon after
      his arrival, he proved that he did not blush to recognize his former
      associates.”

“He made a grand festival at his new brick house,” said Grandfather, “and
      invited all the ship-carpenters of Boston to be his guests. At the head of
      the table, in our great chair, sat Sir William Phips himself, treating
      these hard-handed men as his brethren, cracking jokes with them, and
      talking familiarly about old times. I know not whether he wore his
      embroidered dress; but I rather choose to imagine that he had on a suit of
      rough clothes, such as he used to labor in while he was Phips the
      ship-carpenter.”

“An aristocrat need not be ashamed of the trade,” observed Laurence; “for
      the Czar Peter the Great once served an apprenticeship to it.”

“History says but little about his merits as a ship-carpenter,” answered
      Grandfather; “but, as a governor, a great deal of fault was found with
      him. Almost as soon as he assumed the government, he became engaged in a
      very frightful business, which might have perplexed a wiser and better
      cultivated head than his. This was the witchcraft delusion.”

And here Grandfather gave his auditors such details of this melancholy
      affair as he thought it fit for them to know. They shuddered to hear that
      a frenzy, which led to the death of many innocent persons, had originated
      in the wicked arts of a few children. They belonged to the Rev. Mr.
      Parris, minister of Salem. These children complained of being pinched and
      pricked with pins, and otherwise tormented by the shapes of men and women,
      who were supposed to have power to haunt them invisibly, both in darkness
      and daylight. Often in the midst of their family and friends the children
      would pretend to be seized with strange convulsions, and would cry out
      that the witches were afflicting them.

These stories spread abroad, and caused great tumult and alarm. From the
      foundation of New England, it had been the custom of the inhabitants, in
      all matters of doubt and difficulty, to look to their ministers for
      counsel. So they did now; but, unfortunately, the ministers and wise men
      were more deluded than the illiterate people. Cotton Mather, a very
      learned and eminent clergyman, believed that the whole country was full of
      witches and wizards, who had given up their hopes of heaven, and signed a
      covenant with the evil one.

Nobody could be certain that his nearest neighbor or most intimate friend
      was not guilty of this imaginary crime. The number of those who pretended
      to be afflicted by witchcraft grew daily more numerous; and they bore
      testimony against many of the best and worthiest people. A minister, named
      George Burroughs, was among the accused. In the months of August and
      September, 1692, he and nineteen other innocent men and women were put to
      death. The place of execution was a high hill, on the outskirts of Salem;
      so that many of the sufferers, as they stood beneath the gallows, could
      discern their own habitations in the town.

The martyrdom of these guiltless persons seemed only to increase the
      madness. The afflicted now grew bolder in their accusations. Many people
      of rank and wealth were either thrown into prison or compelled to flee for
      their lives. Among these were two sons of old Simon Bradstreet, the last
      of the Puritan governors. Mr. Willard, a pious minister of Boston, was
      cried out upon as a wizard in open court. Mrs. Hale, the wife of the
      minister of Beverly, was likewise accused. Philip English, a rich merchant
      of Salem, found it necessary to take flight, leaving his property and
      business in confusion. But a short time afterwards, the Salem people were
      glad to invite him back.

“The boldest thing that the accusers did,” continued Grandfather, “was to
      cry out against the governor’s own beloved wife. Yes, the lady of Sir
      William Phips was accused of being a witch and of flying through the air
      to attend witch-meetings. When the governor heard this he probably
      trembled, so that our great chair shook beneath him.”

“Dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clinging closer to his knee, “is
      it true that witches ever come in the night-time to frighten little
      children?”

“No, no, dear little Alice,” replied Grandfather. “Even if there were any
      witches, they would flee away from the presence of a pure-hearted child.
      But there are none; and our forefathers soon became convinced that they
      had been led into a terrible delusion. All the prisoners on account of
      witchcraft were set free. But the innocent dead could not be restored to
      life and the hill where they were executed will always remind people of
      the saddest and most humiliating passage in our history.”

Grandfather then said that the next remarkable event, while Sir William
      Phips remained in the chair, was the arrival at Boston of an English fleet
      in 1698. It brought an army which was intended for the conquest of Canada.
      But a malignant disease, more fatal than the smallpox, broke out among the
      soldiers and sailors, and destroyed the greater part of them. The
      infection spread into the town of Boston, and made much havoc there. This
      dreadful sickness caused the governor and Sir Francis Wheeler, who was
      commander of the British forces, to give up all thoughts of attacking
      Canada.

“Soon after this,” said Grandfather, “Sir William Phips quarrelled with
      the captain of an English frigate, and also with the collector of Boston.
      Being a man of violent temper, he gave each of them a sound beating with
      his cane.”

“He was a bold fellow,” observed Charley, who was himself somewhat
      addicted to a similar mode or settling disputes.

“More bold than wise,” replied Grandfather; “for complaints were carried
      to the king, and Sir William Phips was summoned to England to make the
      best answer he could. Accordingly he went to London, where, in 1695, he
      was seized with a malignant fever, of which he died. Had he lived longer,
      he would probably have gone again in search of sunken treasure. He had
      heard of a Spanish ship, which was cast away in 1502, during the lifetime
      of Columbus. Bovadilla, Roldan, and many other Spaniards were lost in her,
      together with the immense wealth of which they had robbed the South
      American kings.”

“Why, Grandfather!” exclaimed Laurence, “what magnificent ideas the
      governor had! Only think of recovering all that old treasure which had
      lain almost two centuries under the sea! Methinks Sir William Phips ought
      to have been buried in the ocean when he died, so that he might have gone
      down among the sunken ships and cargoes of treasure which he was always
      dreaming about in his lifetime.”

“He was buried in one of the crowded cemeteries of London,” said
      Grandfather. “As he left no children, his estate was inherited by his
      nephew, from whom is descended the present Marquis of Normandy. The noble
      Marquis is not aware, perhaps, that the prosperity of his family
      originated in the successful enterprise of a New England ship-carpenter.”

“At the death of Sir William Phips,” proceeded Grandfather, “our chair was
      bequeathed to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, a famous schoolmaster in Boston. This
      old gentleman came from London in 1637, and had been teaching school ever
      since; so that there were now aged men, grandfathers like myself, to whom
      Master Cheever had taught their alphabet. He was a person of venerable
      aspect, and wore a long white beard.”

“Yes, in his school,” answered Grandfather; “and we may safely say that it
      had never before been regarded with such awful reverence,—no, not
      even when the old governors of Massachusetts sat in it. Even you, Charley,
      my boy, would have felt some respect for the chair if you had seen it
      occupied by this famous schoolmaster.”

And here grandfather endeavored to give his auditors an idea how matters
      were managed in schools above a hundred years ago. As this will probably
      be an interesting subject to our readers, we shall make a separate sketch
      of it, and call it The Old-Fashioned School.

Now, imagine yourselves, my children, in Master Ezekiel Cheever’s
      school-room. It is a large, dingy room, with a sanded floor, and is
      lighted by windows that turn on hinges and have little diamond-shaped
      panes of glass. The scholars sit on long benches, with desks before them.
      At one end of the room is a great fireplace, so very spacious that there
      is room enough for three or four boys to stand in each of the chimney
      corners. This was the good old fashion of fireplaces when there was wood
      enough in the forests to keep people warm without their digging into the
      bowels of the earth for coal.

It is a winter’s day when we take our peep into the school-room. See what
      great logs of wood have been rolled into the fireplace, and what a broad,
      bright blaze goes leaping up the chimney! And every few moments a vast
      cloud of smoke is puffed into the room, which sails slowly over the heads
      of the scholars, until it gradually settles upon the walls and ceiling.
      They are blackened with the smoke of many years already.

Next look at our old historic chair! It is placed, you perceive, in the
      most comfortable part of the room, where the generous glow of the fire is
      sufficiently felt without being too intensely hot. How stately the old
      chair looks, as if it remembered its many famous occupants, but yet were
      conscious that a greater man is sitting in it now! Do you see the
      venerable schoolmaster, severe in aspect, with a black skullcap on his
      head, like an ancient Puritan, and the snow of his white beard drifting
      down to his very girdle? What boy would dare to play; or whisper, or even
      glance aside from his book; while Master Cheever is on the lookout behind
      his spectacles? For such offenders, if any such there be, a rod of birch
      is hanging over the fireplace, and a heavy ferule lies on the master’s
      desk.

And now school is begun. What a murmur of multitudinous tongues, like the
      whispering leaves of a wind-stirred oak, as the scholars con over their
      various tasks! Buzz! buzz! buzz! Amid just such a murmur has Master
      Cheever spent above sixty years; and long habit has made it as pleasant to
      him as the hum of a beehive when the insects are busy in the sunshine.

Now a class in Latin is called to recite. Forth steps a rowel
      queer-looking little fellows, wearing square-skirted coats and
      small-clothes, with buttons at the knee. They look like so many
      grandfathers in their second-childhood. These lads are to be sent to
      Cambridge and educated for the learned professions. Old Master Cheever had
      lived so long, and seen so many generations of school-boys grow up to be
      men, that now he can almost prophesy what sort of a man each boy will be.
      One urchin shall hereafter be a doctor, and administer pills and potions,
      and stalk gravely through life, perfumed with assafoetida. Another shall
      wrangle at the bar, and fight his way to wealth and honors and, in his
      declining age, shall be a worshipful member of his Majesty’s council. A
      third-and he is the master’s favorite—shall be a worthy successor to
      the old Puritan ministers now in their graves; he shall preach with great
      unction and effect, and leave volumes of sermons, in print and manuscript,
      for the benefit of future generations.

But, as they are merely school-boys now, their business is to construe
      Virgil. Poor Virgil! whose verses, which he took so much pains to polish,
      have been misscanned, and misparsed, and misinterpreted by so many
      generations of idle school-boys. There, sit down, ye Latinists. Two or
      three of you, I fear, are doomed to feel the master’s ferule.

Next comes a class in arithmetic. These boys are to be the merchants,
      shopkeepers, and mechanics of a future period. Hitherto they have traded
      only in marbles and apples. Hereafter some will send vessels to England
      for broadcloths and all sorts of manufactured wares, and to the West
      Indies for sugar, and rum, and coffee. Others will stand behind counters,
      and measure tape, and ribbon, and cambric by the yard. Others will upheave
      the blacksmith’s hammer, or drive the plane over the carpenter’s bench, or
      take the lapstone and the awl and learn the trade of shoemaking. Many will
      follow the sea, and become bold, rough sea-captains.

This class of boys, in short, must supply the world with those active,
      skilful hands, and clear, sagacious heads, without which the affairs of
      life would be thrown into confusion by the theories of studious and
      visionary men. Wherefore, teach them their multiplication-table, good
      Master Cheever, and whip them well when they deserve it; for much of the
      country’s welfare depends on these boys.

But, alas! while, we have been thinking of other matters, Master Cheever’s
      watchful eye has caught two boys at play. Now we shall see awful times.
      The two malefactors are summoned before the master’s chair, wherein he
      sits with the terror of a judge upon his brow. Our old chair is now a
      judgment-seat. Ah, Master Cheever has taken down that terrible birch rod!
      Short is the trial,—the sentence quickly passed,—and now the
      judge prepares to execute it in person. Thwack! thwack! thwack! In these
      good old times, a schoolmaster’s blows were well laid on.

See, the birch rod has lost several of its twigs, and will hardly serve
      for another execution. Mercy on his, what a bellowing the urchins make! My
      ears are almost deafened, though the clamor comes through the far length
      of a hundred and fifty years. There, go to your seats, poor boys; and do
      not cry, sweet little Alice, for they have ceased to feel the pain a long
      time since.

And thus the forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve o’clock. The master
      looks at his great silver watch, and then, with tiresome deliberation,
      puts the ferule into his desk. The little multitude await the word of
      dismissal with almost irrepressible impatience.

The boys retire, treading softly until they have passed the threshold;
      but, fairly out of the schoolroom, lo, what a joyous shout! what a
      scampering and trampling of feet! what a sense of recovered freedom
      expressed in the merry uproar of all their voices! What care they for the
      ferule and birch rod now? Were boys created merely to study Latin and
      arithmetic? No; the better purposes of their being are to sport, to leap,
      to run, to shout, to slide upon the ice, to snowball.

Happy boys! Enjoy your playtime now, and come again to study and to feel
      the birch rod and the ferule to-morrow; not till to-morrow; for to-day is
      Thursday lecture; and, ever since the settlement of Massachusetts, there
      has been no school on Thursday afternoons. Therefore sport, boys, while
      you may, for the morrow cometh, with the birch rod and the ferule; and
      after that another morrow, with troubles of its own.

Now the master has set everything to rights, and is ready to go home to
      dinner. Yet he goes reluctantly. The old man has spent so much of his life
      in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room, that, when he has a holiday, he
      feels as if his place were lost and himself a stranger in the world. But
      forth he goes; and there stands our old chair, vacant and solitary, till
      good Master Cheever resumes his seat in it to-morrow morning.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I wonder whether the boys did not use to
      upset the old chair when the schoolmaster was out.”

“There is a tradition,” replied Grandfather, “that one of its arms was
      dislocated in some such manner. But I cannot believe that any school-boy
      would behave so naughtily.”

As it was now later than little Alice’s usual bedtime, Grandfather broke
      off his narrative, promising to talk more about Master Cheever and his
      scholars some other evening.

“Master Ezekiel Cheever,” said he, “died in 1707, after having taught
      school about seventy years. It would require a pretty good scholar in
      arithmetic to tell how many stripes he had inflicted, and how many birch
      rods he had worn out, during all that time, in his fatherly tenderness for
      his pupils. Almost all the great men of that period, and for many years
      back, had been whipped into eminence by Master Cheever. Moreover, he had
      written a Latin Accidence, which was used in schools more than half a
      century after his death; so that the good old man, even in his grave, was
      still the cause of trouble and stripes to idle schoolboys.”

Grandfather proceeded to say, that, when Master Cheever died, he
      bequeathed the chair to the most learned man that was educated at his
      school, or that had ever been born in America. This was the renowned
      Cotton Mather, minister of the Old North Church in Boston.

“Yes, Laurence,” replied Grandfather. “The Magnalia is a strange, pedantic
      history, in which true events and real personages move before the reader
      with the dreamy aspect which they wore in Cotton Mather’s singular mind.
      This huge volume, however, was written and published before our chair came
      into his possession. But, as he was the author of more books than there
      are days in the year, we may conclude that he wrote a great deal while
      sitting in this chair.”

“I am tired of these schoolmasters and learned men,” said Charley. “I wish
      some stirring man, that knew how to do something in the world, like Sir
      William Phips, would sit in the chair.”

“Such men seldom have leisure to sit quietly in a chair,” said
      Grandfather. “We must make the best of such people as we have.”

As Cotton Mather was a very distinguished man, Grandfather took some pains
      to give the children a lively conception of his character. Over the door
      of his library were painted these words, BE SHORT,—as a warning to
      visitors that they must not do the world so much harm as needlessly to
      interrupt this great man’s wonderful labors. On entering the room you
      would probably behold it crowded, and piled, and heaped with books. There
      were huge, ponderous folios, and quartos, and little duodecimos, in
      English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and all other languages that
      either originated at the confusion of Babel or have since come into use.

All these books, no doubt, were tossed about in confusion, thus forming a
      visible emblem of the manner in which their contents were crowded into
      Cotton Mather’s brain. And in the middle of the room stood table, on
      which, besides printed volumes, were strewn manuscript sermons, historical
      tracts, and political pamphlets, all written in such a queer, blind,
      crabbed, fantastical hand, that a writing-master would have gone raving
      mad at the sight of them. By this table stood Grandfather’s chair, which
      seemed to have contracted an air of deep erudition, as if its cushion were
      stuffed with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and other hard matters.

In this chair, from one year’s end to another, sat that prodigious
      bookworm, Cotton Mather, sometimes devouring a great book, and sometimes
      scribbling one as big. In Grandfather’s younger days there used to be a
      wax figure of him in one of the Boston museums, representing a solemn,
      dark-visaged person, in a minister’s black gown, and with a black-letter
      volume before him.

“It is difficult, my children,” observed Grandfather, “to make you
      understand such a character as Cotton Mather’s, in whom there was so much
      good, and yet so many failings and frailties. Undoubtedly he was a pious
      man. Often he kept fasts; and once, for three whole days, he allowed
      himself not a morsel of food, but spent the time in prayer and religious
      meditation. Many a live-long night did he watch and pray. These fasts and
      vigils made him meagre and haggard, and probably caused him to appear as
      if he hardly belonged to the world.”

“He was the chief agent of the mischief,” answered Grandfather; “but we
      will not suppose that he acted otherwise than conscientiously. He believed
      that there were evil spirits all about the world. Doubtless he imagined
      that they were hidden in the corners and crevices of his library, and that
      they peeped out from among the leaves of many of his books, as he turned
      them over, at midnight. He supposed that these unlovely demons were
      everywhere, in the sunshine as well as in the darkness, and that they were
      hidden in men’s hearts, and stole into their most secret thoughts.”

Here Grandfather was interrupted by little Alice, who hid her face in his
      lap, and murmured a wish that he would not talk any more about Cotton
      Mather and the evil spirits. Grandfather kissed her, and told her that
      angels were the only spirits whom she had anything to do with.

A new War between France and England had broken out in 1702, and had been
      raging ever since. In the course of it, New England suffered much injury
      from the French and Indians, who often came through the woods from Canada
      and assaulted the frontier towns. Villages were sometimes burned, and the
      inhabitants slaughtered, within a day’s ride of Boston. The people of New
      England had a bitter hatred against the French, not only for the mischief
      which they did with their own hands, but because they incited the Indians
      to hostility.

The New-Englanders knew that they could never dwell in security until the
      provinces of France should be subdued and brought under the English
      government. They frequently, in time of war, undertook military
      expeditions against Acadia and Canada, and sometimes besieged the
      fortresses by which those territories were defended. But the most earnest
      wish of their hearts was to take Quebec, and so get possession of the
      whole province of Canada. Sir William Phips had once attempted it, but
      without success.

Fleets and soldiers were often sent from England to assist the colonists
      in their warlike undertakings. In 1710 Port Royal, a fortress of Acadia,
      was taken by the English. The next year, in the month of June, a fleet,
      commanded by Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker, arrived in Boston Harbor. On
      board of this fleet was the English General Hill, with seven regiments of
      soldiers, who had been fighting under the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders.
      The government of Massachusetts was called upon to find provisions for the
      army and fleet, and to raise more men to assist in taking Canada.

What with recruiting and drilling of soldiers, there was now nothing but
      warlike bustle in the streets of Boston. The drum and fife, the rattle of
      arms, and the shouts of boys were heard from morning till night. In about
      a month the fleet set sail, carrying four regiments from New England and
      New York, besides the English soldiers. The whole army amounted to at
      least seven thousand men. They steered for the mouth of the river St.
      Lawrence.

“Cotton Mather prayed most fervently for their success,” continued
      Grandfather, “both in his pulpit and when he kneeled down in the solitude
      of his library, resting his face on our old chair. But Providence ordered
      the result otherwise. In a few weeks tidings were received that eight or
      nine of the vessels had been wrecked in the St. Lawrence, and that above a
      thousand drowned soldiers had been washed ashore on the banks of that
      mighty river. After this misfortune Sir Hovenden Walker set sail for
      England; and many pious people began to think it a sin even to wish for
      the conquest of Canada.”

“Nor did they, as we shall see,” replied Grandfather. “However, no more
      attempts were made during this war, which came to a close in 1713. The
      people of New England were probably glad of some repose; for their young
      men had been made soldiers, till many of them were fit for nothing else.
      And those who remained at home had been heavily taxed to pay for the arms,
      ammunition; fortifications, and all the other endless expenses of a war.
      There was great need of the prayers of Cotton Mather and of all pious men,
      not only on account of the sufferings of the people, but because the old
      moral and religious character of New England was in danger of being
      utterly lost.”

“How glorious it would have been,” remarked Laurence, “if our forefathers
      could have kept the country unspotted with blood!”

“Yes,” said Grandfather; “but there was a stern, warlike spirit in them
      from the beginning. They seem never to have thought of questioning either
      the morality or piety of war.”

The next event which Grandfather spoke of was one that Cotton Mather, as
      well as most of the other inhabitants of New England, heartily rejoiced
      at. This was the accession of the Elector of Hanover to the throne of
      England, in 1714, on the death of Queen Anne. Hitherto the people had been
      in continual dread that the male line of the Stuarts, who were descended
      from the beheaded King Charles and the banished King James, would be
      restored to the throne.

“The importance of this event,” observed Grandfather, “was a thousand
      times greater than that of a Presidential election in our own days. If the
      people dislike their President, they may get rid of him in four years;
      whereas a dynasty of kings may wear the crown for an unlimited period.”

The German elector was proclaimed king from the balcony of the town-house
      in Boston, by the title of George I.; while the trumpets sounded and the
      people cried amen. That night the town was illuminated; and Cotton Mather
      threw aside book and pen, and left Grandfather’s chair vacant, while he
      walked hither and thither to witness the rejoicings.

“COTTON MATHER,” continued Grandfather, “was a bitter enemy to Governor
      Dudley; and nobody exulted more than he when that crafty politician was
      removed from the government, and succeeded by Colonel Shute. This took
      place in 1716. The new governor had been an officer in the renowned Duke
      of Marlborough’s army, and had fought in some of the great battles in
      Flanders.”

“I am afraid you will be disappointed, Charley,” answered Grandfather. “It
      is true that Colonel Shute had probably never led so unquiet a life while
      fighting the French as he did now, while governing this province of
      Massachusetts Bay. But his troubles consisted almost entirely of
      dissensions with the Legislature. The king had ordered him to lay claim to
      a fixed salary; but the representatives of the people insisted upon paying
      him only such sums from year to year as they saw fit.”

Grandfather here explained some of the circumstances that made the
      situation of a colonial governor so difficult and irksome. There was not
      the same feeling towards the chief magistrate now that had existed while
      he was chosen by the free suffrages of the people, it was felt that as the
      king appointed the governor, and as he held his office during the king’s
      pleasure, it would be his great object to please the king. But the people
      thought that a governor ought to have nothing in view but the best
      interests of those whom he governed.

“The governor,” remarked Grandfather, “had two masters to serve,—the
      king, who appointed him; and the people, on whom he depended for his pay.
      Few men in this position would have ingenuity enough to satisfy either
      party. Colonel Shute, though a good-natured, well-meaning man, succeeded
      so ill with the people, that, in 1722, he suddenly went away to England
      and made Complaint to King George. In the meantime Lieutenant-Governor
      Dummer directed the affairs of the province, and carried on a long and
      bloody war with the Indians.”

“It still remained in Cotton Mather’s library,” replied Grandfather; “and
      I must not omit to tell you an incident which is very much to the honor of
      this celebrated man. It is the more proper, too, that you should hear it,
      because it will show you what a terrible calamity the smallpox was to our
      forefathers. The history of the province (and, of course, the history of
      our chair) would be incomplete without particular mention of it.”

Accordingly Grandfather told the children a story, to which, for want of a
      better title, we shall give that of The Rejected Blessing.

One day, in 1721, Doctor Cotton Mather sat in his library reading a book
      that had been published by the Royal Society of London. But every few
      moments he laid the book upon the table, and leaned back in Grandfather’s
      chair with an aspect of deep care and disquietude. There were certain
      things which troubled him exceedingly, so that he could hardly fix his
      thoughts upon what he read.

It was now a gloomy time in Boston. That terrible disease; the small-pox,
      had recently made its appearance in the town. Ever since the first
      settlement of the country this awful pestilence had come at intervals, and
      swept away multitudes of the inhabitants. Whenever it commenced its
      ravages, nothing seemed to stay its progress until there were no more
      victims for it to seize upon. Oftentimes hundreds of people at once lay
      groaning with its agony; and when it departed, its deep footsteps were
      always to be traced in many graves.

The people never felt secure from this calamity. Sometimes, perhaps, it
      was brought into the country by a poor sailor, who had caught the
      infection in foreign parts, and came hither to die and to be the cause of
      many deaths. Sometimes, no doubt, it followed in the train of the pompous
      governors when they came over from England. Sometimes the disease lay
      hidden in the cargoes of ships, among silks, and brocades, and other
      costly merchandise which was imported for the rich people to wear. And
      sometimes it started up seemingly of its own accord, and nobody could tell
      whence it came. The physician, being called to attend the sick person,
      would look at him, and say, “It is the small-pox! Let the patient be
      carried to the hospital.”

And now this dreadful sickness had shown itself again in Boston. Cotton
      Mather was greatly afflicted for the sake of the whole province. He had
      children, too, who were exposed to the danger. At that very moment he
      heard the voice of his youngest son, for whom his heart was moved with
      apprehension.

“Alas! I fear for that poor child,” said Cotton Mather to himself. “What
      shall I do for my son Samuel?”

Again he attempted to drive away these thoughts by taking up the book
      which he had been reading. And now, all of a sudden, his attention became
      fixed. The book contained a printed letter that an Italian physician had
      written upon the very subject about which Cotton Mather was so anxiously
      meditating. He ran his eye eagerly over the pages; and, behold! a method
      was disclosed to him by which the small-pox might be robbed of its worst
      terrors. Such a method was known in Greece. The physicians of Turkey, too,
      those long-bearded Eastern sages, had been acquainted with it for many
      years. The negroes of Africa, ignorant as they were, had likewise
      practised it, and thus had shown themselves wiser than the white men.

“Of a truth,” ejaculated Cotton Mather, clasping his hands and looking up
      to heaven, “it was a merciful Providence that brought this book under mine
      eye. I will procure a consultation of physicians, and see whether this
      wondrous inoculation may not stay the progress of the destroyer.”

So he arose from Grandfather’s chair and went out of the library. Near the
      door he met his son Samuel, who seemed downcast and out of spirits. The
      boy had heard, probably, that some of his playmates were taken ill with
      the small-pox. But, as his father looked cheerfully at him, Samuel took
      courage, trusting that either the wisdom of so learned a minister would
      find some remedy for the danger, or else that his prayers would secure
      protection from on high.

Meanwhile Cotton Mather took his staff and three-cornered hat and walked
      about the streets, calling at the houses of all the physicians in Boston.
      They were a very wise fraternity; and their huge wigs, and black dresses,
      and solemn visages made their wisdom appear even profounder than it was.
      One after another he acquainted them with the discovery which he had hit
      upon.

But the grave and sagacious personages would scarcely listen to him. The
      oldest doctor in town contented himself with remarking that no such thing
      as inoculation was mentioned by Galen or Hippocrates; and it was
      impossible that modern physicians should be wiser than those old sages. A
      second held up his hands in dumb astonishment and horror at the mad-ness
      of what Cotton Mather proposed to do. A third told him, in pretty plain
      terms, that he knew not what he was talking about. A fourth requested, in
      the name of the whole medical fraternity, that Cotton Mather would confine
      his attention to people’s souls, and leave the physicians to take care of
      their bodies. In short, there was but a single doctor among them all who
      would grant the poor minister so much as a patient hearing, This was
      Doctor Zabdiel Boylston. He looked into the matter like a man of sense,
      and finding, beyond a doubt, that inoculation had rescued many from death,
      he resolved to try the experiment in his own family.

And so he did. But when the other physicians heard of it they arose in
      great fury and began a war of words, written, printed, and spoken, against
      Cotton Mather and Doctor Boylston. To hear them talk, you would have
      supposed that these two harmless and benevolent men had plotted the ruin
      of the country.

The people, also, took the alarm. Many, who thought themselves more pious
      than their neighbors, contended that, if Providence had ordained them to
      die of the small-pox, it was sinful to aim at preventing it. The strangest
      reports were in circulation. Some said that Doctor Boylston had contrived
      a method for conveying the gout, rheumatism, sick-headache, asthma, and
      all other diseases from one person to another, and diffusing them through
      the whole community. Others flatly affirmed that the evil one had got
      possession of Cotton Mather, and was at the bottom of the whole business.

You must observe, children, that Cotton Mather’s fellow-citizens were
      generally inclined to doubt the wisdom of any measure which he might
      propose to them. They recollected how he had led them astray in the old
      witchcraft delusion; and now, if he thought and acted ever so wisely, it
      was difficult for him to get the credit of it.

The people’s wrath grew so hot at his attempt to guard them from the
      small-pox that he could not walk the streets in peace. Whenever the
      venerable form of the old minister, meagre and haggard with fasts and
      vigils, was seen approaching, hisses were heard, and shouts of derision,
      and scornful and bitter laughter. The women snatched away their children
      from his path, lest he should do them a mischief. Still, however, bending
      his head meekly, and perhaps stretching out his hands to bless those who
      reviled him, he pursued his way. But the tears came into his eyes to think
      how blindly the people rejected the means of safety that were offered
      them.

Indeed, there were melancholy sights enough in the streets of Boston to
      draw forth the tears of a compassionate man. Over the door of almost every
      dwelling a red flag was fluttering in the air. This was the signal that
      the small-pox had entered the house and attacked some member of the
      family; or perhaps the whole family, old and young, were struggling at
      once with the pestilence. Friends and relatives, when they met one another
      in the streets, would hurry onward without a grasp of the hand or scarcely
      a word of greeting, lest they should catch or communicate the contagion;
      and often a coffin was borne hastily along.

“Alas! alas!” said Cotton Mather to himself, “what shall be done for this
      poor, misguided people? Oh that Providence would open their eyes, and
      enable them to discern good from evil!”

So furious, however, were the people, that they threatened vengeance
      against any person who should dare to practise inoculation, though it were
      only in his own family. This was a hard case for Cotton Mather, who saw no
      other way to rescue his poor child Samuel from the disease. But he
      resolved to save him, even if his house should be burned over his head.

“I will not be turned aside,” said he. “My townsmen shall see that I have
      faith in this thing, when I make the experiment on my beloved son, whose
      life is dearer to me than my own. And when I have saved Samuel,
      peradventure they will be persuaded to save themselves.”

Accordingly Samuel was inoculated; and so was Mr. Walter, a son-in-law of
      Cotton Mather. Doctor Boyleston, likewise, inoculated many persons; and
      while hundreds died who had caught the contagion from the garments of the
      sick, almost all were preserved who followed the wise physician’s advice.

But the people were not yet convinced of their mistake. One night a
      destructive little instrument, called a hand-grenade, was thrown into
      Cotton Mather’s window, and rolled under Grandfather’s chair. It was
      supposed to be filled with gunpowder, the explosion of which would have
      blown the poor minister to atoms. But the best informed historians are of
      opinion that the grenade contained only brimstone and assafoetida, and was
      meant to plague Cotton Mather with a very evil perfume.

This is no strange thing in human experience. Men who attempt to do the
      world mere good than the world is able entirely to comprehend are almost
      invariably held in bad odor. But yet, if the wise and good man can wait
      awhile, either the present generation or posterity will do him justice. So
      it proved in the case which we have been speaking of. In after years, when
      inoculation was universally practised, and thousands were saved from death
      by it, the people remembered old Cotton Mather, then sleeping in his
      grave. They acknowledged that the very thing for which they had so reviled
      and persecuted him was the best and wisest thing he ever did.

“No, Clara,” replied Grandfather. “But it is right that you should know
      what a dark shadow this disease threw over the times of our forefathers.
      And now, if you wish to learn more about Cotton Mather, you must read his
      biography, written by Mr. Peabody, of Springfield. You will find it very
      entertaining and instructive; but perhaps the writer is somewhat too harsh
      in his judgment of this singular man. He estimates him fairly, indeed, and
      understands him well; but he unriddles his character rather by acuteness
      than by sympathy. Now, his life should have been written by one who,
      knowing all his faults, would nevertheless love him.”

So Grandfather made an end of Cotton Mather, telling his auditors that he
      died in 1728, at the age of sixty-five, and bequeathed the chair to Elisha
      Cooke. This gentleman was a famous advocate of the people’s rights.

The same year William Burner, a son of the celebrated Bishop Burnet,
      arrived in Boston with the commission of governor. He was the first that
      had been appointed since the departure of Colonel Shute, Governor Burnet
      took up his residence with Mr. Cooke while the Province House was
      undergoing repairs. During this period he was always complimented with a
      seat in Grandfather’s chair; and so comfortable did he find it, that, on
      removing to the Province House, he could not bear to leave it behind him.
      Mr. Cooke, therefore, requested his acceptance of it.

“I should think,” said Laurence, “that the people would have petitioned
      the king always to appoint a native-born New-Englander to govern them.”

“Undoubtedly it was a grievance,” answered Grandfather, “to see men placed
      in this station who perhaps had neither talents nor virtues to fit them
      for it, and who certainly could have no natural affection for the country.
      The king generally bestowed the governorships of the American colonies
      upon needy noblemen, or hangers-on at court, or disbanded officers. The
      people knew that such persons would be very likely to make the good of the
      country subservient to the wishes of the king. The Legislature, therefore,
      endeavored to keep as much power as possible in their own hands, by
      refusing to settle a fixed salary upon the governors. It was thought
      better to pay them according to their deserts.”

Grandfather could not help smiling at the simplicity of Charley’s
      question. Nevertheless, it put the matter in a very plain point of view.

He then described the character of Governor Bur-net, representing him as a
      good scholar, possessed of much ability, and likewise of unspotted
      integrity. His story affords a striking example how unfortunate it is for
      a man, who is placed as ruler over a country to be compelled to aim at
      anything but the good of the people. Governor Burnet was so chained down
      by his instructions from the king that he could not act as he might
      otherwise have wished. Consequently, his whole term of office was wasted
      in quarrels with the Legislature.

“I am afraid, children,” said Grandfather, “that Governor Burner found but
      little rest or comfort in our old chair. Here he used to sit, dressed in a
      coat which was made of rough, shaggy cloth outside, but of smooth velvet
      within. It was said that his own character resembled that coat; for his
      outward manner was rough, but his inward disposition soft and kind. It is
      a pity that such a man could not have been kept free from trouble. But so
      harassing were his disputes with the representatives of the people that he
      fell into a fever, of which he died in 1729. The Legislature had refused
      him a salary while alive; but they appropriated money enough to give him a
      splendid and pompous funeral.”

And now Grandfather perceived that little Alice had fallen fast asleep,
      with her head upon his footstool. Indeed, as Clara observed, she had been
      sleeping from the time of Sir Hovenden Walker’s expedition against Quebec
      until the death of Governor Burnet,—a period of about eighteen
      years. And yet, after so long a nap, sweet little Alice was a
      golden-haired child of scarcely five years old.

“It puts me in mind,” said Laurence, “of the story of the enchanted
      princess, who slept many a hundred years, and awoke as young and beautiful
      as ever.”

A FEW evenings afterwards, cousin Clara happened inquire of Grandfather
      whether the old chair had never been present at a ball. At the same time
      little Alice brought forward a doll, with whom she had been holding a long
      conversation.

These questions led Grandfather to talk about the fashions and manners
      which now began to be introduced from England into the provinces. The
      simplicity of the good old Puritan times was fast disappearing. This was
      partly owing to the increasing number and wealth of the inhabitants, and
      to the additions which they continually received by the arrival and
      settlement of people from beyond the sea.

Another cause of a pompous and artificial mode of life, among those who
      could afford it, was that the example was set by the royal governors.
      Under the old charter, the governors were the representatives of the
      people, and therefore their way of living had probably been marked by a
      popular simplicity. But now, as they represented the person of the king,
      they thought it necessary to preserve the dignity of their station by the
      practice of high and gorgeous ceremonials. And, besides, the profitable
      offices under the government were filled by men who had lived in London,
      and had there contracted fashionable and luxurious habits of living which
      they would not now lay aside. The wealthy people of the province imitated
      them; and thus began a general change in social life.

“So, my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “after our chair had entered the
      Province House, it must often have been present at balls and festivals;
      though I cannot give you a description of any particular one. But I doubt
      not that they were very magnificent; and slaves in gorgeous liveries
      waited on the guests, and offered them wine in goblets of massive silver.”

“Yes, black slaves and white,” replied Grandfather. “Our ancestors not
      only brought negroes from Africa, but Indians from South America, and
      white people from Ireland. These last were sold, not for life, but for a
      certain number of years, in order to pay the expenses of their voyage
      across the Atlantic. Nothing was more common than to see a lot of likely
      Irish girls advertised for sale in the newspapers. As for the little negro
      babies, they were offered to be giver away like young kittens.”

“Perhaps Alice would have liked one to play with, instead of her doll,”
       said Charley, laughing.

“Now, as for this pretty doll, my little Alice,” said Grandfather, “I wish
      you could have seen what splendid dresses the ladies wore in those times.
      They had silks, and satins, and damasks, and brocades, and high
      head-dresses, and all sorts of fine things. And they used to wear hooped
      petticoats of such enormous size that it was quite a journey to walk round
      them.”

“With full as much magnificence as the ladies,” answered Grandfather. “For
      their holiday suits they had coats of figured velvet, crimson, green,
      blue, and all other gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace.
      Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very
      splendid. Sometimes the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the
      knees, was made of gold brocade.”

“And then,” continued Grandfather, “they wore various sorts of periwigs,
      such as the tie, the Spencer, the brigadier, the major, the Albemarle, the
      Ramillies, the feather-top, and the full-bottom. Their three-cornered hats
      were laced with gold or silver. They had shining buckles at the knees of
      their small-clothes, and buckles likewise in their shoes. They wore swords
      with beautiful hilts, either of silver, or sometimes of polished steel,
      inlaid with gold.”

“And an embroidered crimson velvet coat,” said Clara, laughing, “and a
      gold brocade waistcoat down to your knees.”

“And a periwig,” added little Alice, soberly, not knowing what was the
      article of dress which she recommended to our friend Charley.

Grandfather smiled at the idea of Charley’s sturdy little figure in such a
      grotesque caparison. He then went on with the history of the chair, and
      told the children that, in 1730, King George II. appointed Jonathan
      Belcher to be governor of Massachusetts in place of the deceased Governor
      Burner. Mr. Belcher was a native of the province, but had spent much of
      his life in Europe.

The new governor found Grandfather’s chair in the Province House. He was
      struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion that age and
      hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company as when it
      stood in the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was
      fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This
      was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of
      the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion’s head
      now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally Governor Belcher gave the
      chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.

“Our good old chair being thus glorified,” proceeded Grandfather, “it
      glittered with a great deal more splendor than it had exhibited just a
      century before, when the Lady Arbella brought it over from England. Most
      people mistook it for a chair of the latest London fashion. And this may
      serve for an example, that there is almost always an old and timeworn
      substance under all the glittering show of new invention.”

“Grandfather, I cannot see any of the gilding,” remarked Charley, who had
      been examining the chair very minutely.

“You will not wonder that it has been rubbed off,” replied Grandfather,
      “when you hear all the adventures that have since befallen the chair.
      Gilded it was; and the handsomest room in the Province House was adorned
      by it.”

There was not much to interest the children in what happened during the
      years that Governor Belcher remained in the chair. At first, like Colonel
      Shute and Governor Burner, he was engaged in disputing with the
      Legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a
      fixed sum, he finally obtained the king’s leave to accept whatever the
      Legislature chose to give him. And thus the people triumphed, after this
      long contest for the privilege of expending their own money as they saw
      fit.

The remainder of Governor Belcher’s term of office was principally taken
      up in endeavoring to settle the currency. Honest John Hull’s pine-tree
      shillings had long ago been worn out, or lost, or melted down again; and
      their place was supplied by bills of paper or parchment, which were
      nominally valued at threepence and upwards. The value of these bills kept
      continually sinking, because the real hard money could not be obtained for
      them. They were a great deal worse than the old Indian currency of
      clam-shells. These disorders of the circulating medium were a source of
      endless plague and perplexity to the rulers and legislators, not only in
      Governor Belcher’s days, but for many years before and afterwards.

Finally the people suspected that Governor Belcher was secretly
      endeavoring to establish the Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces.
      There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining to cause most of the
      true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great
      exertions were made to induce the king to remove the governor.
      Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and
      Grandfather’s chair into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley.

“WILLIAM SHIRLEY,” said Grandfather, “had come from England a few years
      before, and begun to practise law in Boston. You will think, perhaps,
      that, as he had been a lawyer, the new governor used to sit in our great
      chair reading heavy law-books from morning till night. On the contrary, he
      was as stirring and active a governor as Massachusetts ever had. Even Sir
      William Phips hardly equalled him. The first year or two of his
      administration was spent in trying to regulate the currency. But in 1744,
      after a peace of more than thirty years, war broke out between France and
      England.”

“Not exactly, Charley,” said Grandfather; “though you have made a pretty
      shrewd conjecture. He planned, in 1745, an expedition against Louisburg.
      This was a fortified city, on the island of Cape Breton, near Nova Scotia.
      Its walls were of immense height and strength, and were defended by
      hundreds of heavy cannon. It was the strongest fortress which the French
      possessed in America; and if the king of France had guessed Governor
      Shirley’s intentions, he would have sent all the ships he could muster to
      protect it.”

As the siege of Louisburg was one of the most remarkable events that ever
      the inhabitants of New England were engaged in, Grandfather endeavored to
      give his auditors a lively idea of the spirit with which they set about
      it. We shall call his description The Provincial Muster.

The expedition against Louisburg first began to be thought of in the month
      of January. From that time the governor’s chair was continually surrounded
      by councillors, representatives, clergymen, captains, pilots, and all
      manner of people, with whom he consulted about this wonderful project.

First of all, it was necessary to provide men and arms. The Legislature
      immediately sent out a huge quantity of paper-money, with which, as if by
      magic spell, the governor hoped to get possession of all the old cannon,
      powder and balls, rusty swords and muskets, and everything else that would
      be serviceable in killing Frenchmen. Drums were beaten in all the villages
      of Massachusetts to enlist soldiers for the service. Messages were sent to
      the other governors of New England, and to New York and Pennsylvania,
      entreating them to unite in this crusade against the French. All these
      provinces agreed to give what assistance they could.

But there was one very important thing to be decided. Who shall be the
      general of this great army? Peace had continued such an unusual length of
      time that there was now less military experience among the colonists than
      at any former period. The old Puritans had always kept their weapons
      bright, and were never destitute of warlike captains who were skilful in
      assault or defence. But the swords of their descendents had grown rusty by
      disuse. There was nobody in New England that knew anything about sieges or
      any other regular fighting. The only persons at all acquainted with
      warlike business were a few elderly men, who had hunted Indians through
      the underbrush of the forest in old Governor Dummer’s War.

In this dilemma Governor Shirley fixed upon a wealthy merchant, named
      William Pepperell, who was pretty well known and liked among the people.
      As to military skill, he had no more of it than his neighbors. But, as the
      governor urged him very pressingly, Mr. Pepperell consented to shut up his
      ledger, gird on a sword, and assume the title of general.

Meantime, what a hubbub was raised by this scheme! Rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub! The rattle of drums, beaten out of all manner of time, was
      heard above every other sound.

Nothing now was so valuable as arms, of whatever style and fashion they
      might be. The bellows blew, and the hammer clanged continually upon the
      anvil, while the blacksmiths were repairing the broken weapons of other
      wars. Doubtless some of the soldiers lugged out those enormous, heavy
      muskets which used to be fired, with rests, in the time of the early
      Puritans. Great horse-pistols, too, were found, which would go off with a
      bang like a cannon. Old cannon, with touchholes almost as big as their
      muzzles, were looked upon as inestimable treasures. Pikes which, perhaps,
      had been handled by Miles Standish’s soldiers, now made their appearance
      again. Many a young man ransacked the garret and brought forth his
      great-grandfather’s sword, corroded with rust and stained with the blood
      of King Philip’s War.

Never had there been such an arming as this, when a people, so long
      peaceful, rose to the war with the best weapons that they could lay their
      hands upon. And still the drums were heard—rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub!—in all the towns and villages; and louder and more
      numerous grew the trampling footsteps of the recruits that marched behind.

And now the army began to gather into Boston. Tan, lanky, awkward fellows
      came in squads, and companies, and regiments, swaggering along, dressed in
      their brown homespun clothes and blue yarn stockings. They stooped as if
      they still had hold of the plough-handles, and marched without any time or
      tune. Hither they came, from the cornfields, from the clearing in the
      forest, from the blacksmith’s forge, from the carpenter’s workshop, and
      from the shoemaker’s seat. They were an army of rough faces and sturdy
      frames. A trained officer of Europe would have laughed at them till his
      sides had ached. But there was a spirit in their bosoms which is more
      essential to soldiership than to wear red coats and march in stately ranks
      to the sound of regular music.

Still was heard the beat of the drum,—rub-a-dub-dub! And now a host
      of three or four thousand men had found their way to Boston. Little quiet
      was there then! Forth scampered the school-boys, shouting behind the
      drums. The whole town, the whole land, was on fire with war.

After the arrival of the troops, they were probably reviewed upon the
      Common. We may imagine Governor Shirley and General Pepperell riding
      slowly along the line, while the drummers beat strange old tunes, like
      psalm-tunes, and all the officers and soldiers put on their most warlike
      looks. It would have been a terrible sight for the Frenchmen, could they
      but have witnessed it!

At length, on the 24th of March, 1745, the army gave a parting shout, and
      set sail from Boston in ten or twelve vessels which had been hired by the
      governor. A few days afterwards an English fleet, commanded by Commodore
      Peter Warren, sailed also for Louisburg to assist the provincial army. So
      now, after all this bustle of preparation, the town and province were left
      in stillness and repose.

But stillness and repose, at such a time of anxious expectation, are hard
      to bear. The hearts of the old people and women sunk within them when they
      reflected what perils they had sent their sons, and husbands, and brothers
      to encounter. The boys loitered heavily to School, missing the
      rub-a-dub-dub and the trampling march, in the rear of which they had so
      lately run and shouted. All the ministers prayed earnestly in their
      pulpits for a blessing on the army of New England. In every family, when
      the good man lifted up his heart in domestic worship, the burden of his
      petition was for the safety of those dear ones who were fighting under the
      walls of Louisburg.

Governor Shirley all this time was probably in an ecstasy of impatience.
      He could not sit still a moment. He found no quiet, not even in
      Grandfather’s chair; but hurried to and fro, and up and down the staircase
      of the Province House. Now he mounted to the cupola and looked seaward,
      straining his eyes to discover if there were a sail upon the horizon. Now
      he hastened down the stairs, and stood beneath the portal, on the red
      free-stone steps, to receive some mud-bespattered courier, from whom he
      hoped to hear tidings of the army. A few weeks after the departure of the
      troops, Commodore Warren sent a small vessel to Boston with two French
      prisoners. One of them was Monsieur Bouladrie, who had been commander of a
      battery outside the walls of Louisburg. The other was the Marquis de la
      Maison Forte, captain of a French frigate which had been taken by
      Commodore Warren’s fleet. These prisoners assured Governor Shirley that
      the fortifications of Louisburg were far too strong ever to be stormed by
      the provincial army.

Day after day and week after week went on. The people grew almost
      heart-sick with anxiety; for the flower of the country was at peril in
      this adventurous expedition. It was now daybreak on the morning of the 3d
      of July.

But hark! what sound is this? The hurried clang of a bell! There is the
      Old North pealing suddenly out!—there the Old South strikes in!—now
      the peal comes from the church in Brattle Street!—the bells of nine
      or ten steeples are all flinging their iron voices at once upon the
      morning breeze! Is it joy, or alarm? There goes the roar of a cannon too!
      A royal salute is thundered forth. And now we hear the loud exulting shout
      of a multitude assembled in the street. Huzza! huzza! Louisburg has
      surrendered! Huzza!

“O Grandfather, how glad I should have been to live in those times!” cried
      Charley. “And what reward did the king give to General Pepperell and
      Governor Shirley?”

“He made Pepperell a baronet; so that he was now to be called Sir William
      Pepperell,” replied Grandfather. “He likewise appointed both Pepperell and
      Shirley to be colonels in the royal army. These rewards, and higher ones,
      were well deserved; for this was the greatest triumph that the English met
      with in the whole course of that war. General Pepperell became a man of
      great fame. I have seen a full-length portrait of him, representing him in
      a splendid scarlet uniform, standing before the walls of Louisburg, while
      several bombs are falling through the air.”

“But did the country gain any real good by the conquest of Louisburg?”
       asked Laurence. “Or was all the benefit reaped by Pepperell and Shirley?”

“The English Parliament,” replied Grandfather, “agreed to pay the
      colonists for all the expenses of the siege. Accordingly, in 1749, two
      hundred and fifteen chests of Spanish dollars and one hundred casks of
      copper coin were brought from England to Boston. The whole amount was
      about a million of dollars. Twenty-seven carts and trucks carried this
      money from the wharf to the provincial treasury. Was not this a pretty
      liberal reward?”

“The mothers of the young men who were killed at the siege of Louisburg
      would not have thought it so,” said Laurence.

“No; Laurence,” rejoined Grandfather; “and every warlike achievement
      involves an amount of physical and moral evil, for which all the gold in
      the Spanish mines would not be the slightest recompense. But we are to
      consider that this siege was one of the occasions on which the colonists
      tested their ability for war, and thus were prepared for the great contest
      of the Revolution. In that point of view, the valor of our forefathers was
      its own reward.”

Grandfather went on to say that the success of the expedition against
      Louisburg induced Shirley and Pepperell to form a scheme for conquering
      Canada, This plan, however, was not carried into execution.

In the year 1746 great terror was excited by the arrival of a formidable
      French fleet upon the coast It was commanded by the Duke d’Anville, and
      consisted of forty ships of war, besides vessels with soldiers on board.
      With this force the French intended to retake Louisburg, and afterwards to
      ravage the whole of New England. Many people were ready to give up the
      country for lost.

But the hostile fleet met with so many disasters and losses by storm and
      shipwreck, that the Duke d’Anville is said to have poisoned himself in
      despair. The officer next in command threw himself upon his sword and
      perished. Thus deprived of their commanders, the remainder of the ships
      returned to France. This was as great a deliverance for New England as
      that which Old England had experienced in the days of Queen Elizabeth,
      when the Spanish Armada was wrecked upon her coast.

“In 1747,” proceeded Grandfather, “Governor Shirley was driven from the
      Province House, not by a hostile fleet and army, but by a mob of the
      Boston people. They were so incensed at the conduct of the British
      Commodore Knowles, who had impressed some of their fellow-citizens, that
      several thousands of them surrounded the council chamber and threw stones
      and brickbats into the windows. The governor attempted to pacify them; but
      not succeeding, he thought it necessary to leave the town and take refuge
      within the walls of Castle William. Quiet was not restored until Commodore
      Knowles had sent back the impressed men. This affair was a flash of spirit
      that might have warned the English not to venture upon any oppressive
      measures against their colonial brethren.”

Peace being declared between France and England in 1748, the governor had
      now an opportunity to sit at his ease in Grandfather’s chair. Such repose,
      however, appears not to have suited his disposition; for in the following
      year he went to England, and thence was despatched to France on public
      business. Meanwhile, as Shirley had not resigned his office,
      Lieu-tenant-Governor Phips acted as chief magistrate in his stead.

IN the early twilight of Thanksgiving Eve came Laurence, and Clara, and
      Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, and stood in a semicircle round
      Grandfather’s chair. They had been joyous throughout that day of
      festivity, mingling together in all kinds of play, so that the house had
      echoed with their airy mirth.

Grandfather, too, had been happy though not mirthful. He felt that this
      was to be set down as one of the good Thanksgivings of his life. In truth,
      all his former Thanksgivings had borne their part in the present one; for
      his years of infancy, and youth, and manhood, with their blessings and
      their griefs, had flitted before him while he sat silently in the great
      chair. Vanished scenes had been pictured in the air. The forms of departed
      friends had visited him. Voices to be heard no more on earth had sent an
      echo from the infinite and the eternal. These shadows, if such they were,
      seemed almost as real to him as what was actually present,—as the
      merry shouts and laughter of the children,—as their figures, dancing
      like sunshine before his eyes.

He felt that the past was not taken from him. The happiness of former days
      was a possession forever. And there was something in the mingled sorrow of
      his lifetime that became akin to happiness, after being long treasured in
      the depths of his heart. There it underwent a change, and grew more
      precious than pure gold.

And now came the children, somewhat aweary with their wild play, and
      sought the quiet enjoyment of Grandfather’s talk. The good old gentleman
      rubbed his eyes and smiled round upon them all. He was glad, as most aged
      people are, to find that he was yet of consequence, and could give
      pleasure to the world. After being so merry all day long, did these
      children desire to hear his sober talk? Oh, then, old Grandfather had yet
      a place to fill among living men,—or at least among boys and girls!

And truly our yellow friend, the cat, lay upon the hearth-rug, basking in
      the warmth of the fire, pricking up her ears, and turning her head from
      the children to Grandfather, and from Grandfather to the children as if
      she felt herself very sympathetic with them all. A loud purr, like the
      singing of a tea-kettle or the hum of a spinning-wheel, testified that she
      was as comfortable and happy as a cat could be. For puss had feasted; and
      therefore, like Grandfather and the children, had kept a good
      Thanksgiving.

“Does pussy want to hear me?” said Grandfathers smiling. “Well, we must
      please pussy, if we can.”

And so he took up the history of the chair from the epoch of the peace of
      1748. By one of the provisions of the treaty, Louisburg, which the
      New-Englanders had been at so much pains to take, was restored to the King
      of France.

The French were afraid that, unless their colonies should be better
      defended than heretofore, another war might deprive them of the whole.
      Almost as soon as peace was declared, therefore, they began to build
      strong fortifications in the interior of North America. It was strange to
      behold these warlike castles on the banks of solitary lakes and far in the
      midst of woods. The Indian, paddling his birch canoe on Lake Champlain,
      looked up at the high ramparts of Ticonderoga, stone piled on stone,
      bristling with cannon, and the white flag of France floating above. There
      were similar fortifications on Lake Ontario, and near the great Falls of
      Niagara, and at the sources of the Ohio River. And all around these forts
      and castles lay the eternal forest, and the roll of the drum died away in
      those deep solitudes.

The truth was, that the French intended to build forts all the way from
      Canada to Louisiana. They would then have had a wall of military strength
      at the back of the English settlements so as completely to hem them in.
      The King of England considered the building of these forts as a sufficient
      cause of war, which was accordingly commenced in 1754.

“Governor Shirley,” said Grandfather, “had returned to Boston in 1753.
      While in Paris he had married a second wife, a young French girl, and now
      brought her to the Province House. But when war was breaking out it was
      impossible for such a bustling man to stay quietly at home, sitting in our
      old chair, with his wife and children, round about him. He therefore
      obtained a command in the English forces.”

“He stayed at home,” said Grandfather, “and was general of the militia.
      The veteran regiments of the English army which were now sent across the
      Atlantic would have scorned to fight under the orders of an old American
      merchant. And now began what aged people call the old French War. It would
      be going too far astray from the history of our chair to tell you one half
      of the battles that were fought. I cannot even allow myself to describe
      the bloody defeat of General Braddock, near the sources of the Ohio River,
      in 1755. But I must not omit to mention that, when the English general was
      mortally wounded and his army routed, the remains of it were preserved by
      the skill and valor of George Washington.”

At the mention of this illustrious name the children started as if a
      sudden sunlight had gleamed upon the history of their country, now that
      the great deliverer had arisen above the horizon.

Among all the events of the old French War, Grandfather thought that there
      was none more interesting than the removal of the inhabitants of Acadia.
      From the first settlement of this ancient province of the French, in 1604,
      until the present time, its people could scarcely ever know what kingdom
      held dominion over them. They were a peaceful race, taking no delight in
      warfare, and caring nothing for military renown. And yet, in every war,
      their region was infested with iron-hearted soldiers, both French and
      English, who fought one another for the privilege of ill-treating these
      poor, harmless Acadians. Sometimes the treaty of peace made them subjects
      of one king, sometimes of another.

At the peace of 1748 Acadia had been ceded to England. But the French
      still claimed a large portion of it, and built forts for its defence. In
      1755 these forts were taken, and the whole of Acadia was conquered by
      three thousand men from Massachusetts, under the command of General
      Winslow. The inhabitants were accused of supplying the French with
      provisions, and of doing other things that violated their neutrality.

“These accusations were probably true,” observed Grandfather; “for the
      Acadians were descended from the French, and had the same friendly
      feelings towards them that the people of Massachusetts had for the
      English. But their punishment was severe. The English determined to tear
      these poor people from their native homes and scatter them abroad.”

The Acadians were about seven thousand in number. A considerable part of
      them were made prisoners, and transported to the English colonies. All
      their dwellings and churches were burned, their cattle were killed, and
      the whole country was laid waste, so that none of them might find shelter
      or food in their old homes after the departure of the English. One
      thousand of the prisoners were sent to Massachusetts; and Grandfather
      allowed his fancy to follow them thither, and tried to give his auditors
      an idea of their situation.

A sad day it was for the poor Acadians when the armed soldiers drove them,
      at the point of the bayonet, down to the sea-shore. Very sad were they,
      likewise, while tossing upon the ocean in the crowded transport vessels.
      But methinks it must have been sadder still when they were landed on the
      Long Wharf in Boston, and left to themselves on a foreign strand.

Then, probably, they huddled together and looked into one another’s faces
      for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto they had been confined on
      board of separate vessels, so that they could not tell whether their
      relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. But now, at least,
      they could tell that many had been left behind or transported to other
      regions.

Now a desolate wife might be heard calling for her husband. He, alas! had
      gone, she knew not whither; or perhaps had fled into the woods of Acadia,
      and had now returned to weep over the ashes of their dwelling.

An aged widow was crying out in a querulous, lamentable tone for her son,
      whose affectionate toil had supported her for many a. year. He was not in
      the crowd of exiles; and what could this aged widow do but sink down and
      die? Young men and maidens, whose hearts had been torn asunder by
      separation, had hoped, during the voyage, to meet their beloved ones at
      its close. Now they began to feel that they were separated forever. And
      perhaps a lonesome little girl, a golden-haired child of five years old,
      the very picture of our little Alice, was weeping and wailing for her
      mother, and found not a soul to give her a kind word.

Oh, how many broken bonds of affection were here! Country lost,—friends
      lost,—their rural wealth of cottage, field, and herds all lost
      together! Every tie between these poor exiles and the world seemed to be
      cut off at once. They must have regretted that they had not died before
      their exile; for even the English would not have been so pitiless as to
      deny them graves in their native soil. The dead were happy; for they were
      not exiles!

While they thus stood upon the wharf, the curiosity and inquisitiveness of
      the New England people would naturally lead them into the midst of the
      poor Acadians. Prying busybodies thrust their heads into the circle
      wherever two or three of the exiles were conversing together. How puzzled
      did they look at the outlandish sound of the French tongue! There were
      seen the New England women, too. They had just come out of their warm,
      safe homes, where everything was regular and comfortable, and where their
      husbands and children would be with them at nightfall. Surely they could
      pity the wretched wives and mothers of Acadia! Or aid the sign of the
      cross which the Acadians continually made upon their breasts, and which
      was abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans,—did that sign
      exclude all pity?

Among the spectators, too, was the noisy brood of Boston school-boys, who
      came running, with laughter and shouts, to gaze at this crowd of oddly
      dressed foreigners. At first they danced and capered around them, full of
      merriment and mischief. But the despair of the Acadians soon had its
      effect upon these thoughtless lads, and melted them into tearful sympathy.

At a little distance from the throng might be seen the wealthy and pompous
      merchants whose warehouses stood on Long Wharf. It was difficult to touch
      these rich men’s hearts; for they had all the comforts of the world at
      their command; and when they walked abroad their feelings were seldom
      moved, except by the roughness of the pavement irritating their gouty
      toes. Leaning upon their gold-headed canes, they watched the scene with an
      aspect of composure. But let us hype they distributed some of their
      superfluous coin among these hapless exiles to purchase food and a night’s
      lodging.

After standing a long time at the end of the wharf, gazing seaward, as if
      to catch a glimpse of their lost Acadia, the strangers began to stray into
      the town.

They went, we will suppose, in parties and groups, here a hundred, there a
      score, there ten, there three or four, who possessed some bond of unity
      among themselves. Here and there was one who, utterly desolate, stole away
      by himself, seeking no companionship.

Whither did they go? I imagine them wandering about the streets, telling
      the townspeople, in outlandish, unintelligible words, that no earthly
      affliction ever equalled what had befallen them. Man’s brotherhood with
      man was sufficient to make the New-Englanders understand this language.
      The strangers wanted food. Some of them sought hospitality at the doors of
      the stately mansions which then stood in the vicinity of Hanover Street
      and the North Square. Others were applicants at the humble wooden
      tenements, where dwelt the petty shopkeepers and mechanics. Pray Heaven
      that no family in Boston turned one of these poor exiles from their door!
      It would be a reproach upon New England,—a crime worthy of heavy
      retribution,—if the aged women and children, or even the strong men,
      were allowed to feel the pinch of hunger.

Perhaps some of the Acadians, in their aimless wanderings through the
      town, found themselves near a large brick edifice, which was fenced in
      from the street by an iron railing, wrought with fantastic figures. They
      saw a flight of red freestone steps ascending to a portal, above which was
      a balcony and balustrade. Misery and desolation give men the right of free
      passage everywhere. Let us suppose, then, that they mounted the flight of
      steps and passed into the Province House. Making their way into one of the
      apartments, they beheld a richly-clad gentleman, seated in a stately
      chair, with gilding upon the carved work of its back, and a gilded lion’s
      head at the summit. This was Governor Shirley, meditating upon matters of
      war and state, in Grandfather’s chair!

If such an incident did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of
      peaceful and humble hopes had been wrought by the cold policy of the
      statesman and the iron band of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral
      from it. It should have taught him that the poor man’s hearth is sacred,
      and that armies and nations have no right to violate it. It should have
      made him feel that England’s triumph and increased dominion could not
      compensate to mankind nor atone to Heaven for the ashes of a single
      Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.

“Grandfather,” cried Laurence, with emotion trembling in his voice, “did
      iron-hearted War itself ever do so hard and cruel a thing as this before?”

“You have read in history, Laurence, of whole regions wantonly laid
      waste,” said Grandfather. “In the removal of the Acadians, the troops were
      guilty of no cruelty or outrage, except what was inseparable from the
      measure.”

Little Alice, whose eyes had all along been brimming full of tears, now
      burst forth a-sobbing; for Grandfather had touched her sympathies more
      than he intended.

“To think of a whole people homeless in the world!” said Clara, with
      moistened eyes. “There never was anything so sad!”

“It was their own fault!” cried Charley, energetically. “Why did not they
      fight for the country where they were born? Then, if the worst had
      happened to them, they could only have been killed and buried there. They
      would not have been exiles then.”

“Certainly their lot was as hard as death,” said Grandfather. “All that
      could be done for them in the English provinces was, to send them to the
      almshouses, or bind them out to taskmasters. And this was the fate of
      persons who had possessed a comfortable property in their native country.
      Some of them found means to embark for France; but though it was the land
      of their forefathers, it must have been a foreign land to them. Those who
      remained behind always cherished a belief that the King of France would
      never make peace with England till his poor Acadians were restored to
      their country and their homes.”

“Alas! my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “it is improbable that the
      slightest whisper of the woes of Acadia ever reached the ears of Louis XV.
      The exiles grew old in the British provinces, and never saw Acadia again.
      Their descendants remain among us to this day. They have forgotten the
      language of their ancestors, and probably retain no tradition of their
      misfortunes. But, methinks, if I were an American poet, I would choose
      Acadia for the subject of my song.”

Since Grandfather first spoke these words, the most famous of American
      poets has drawn sweet tears from all of us by his beautiful poem
      Evangeline.

And now, having thrown a gentle gloom around the Thanksgiving fireside by
      a story that made the children feel the blessing of a secure and peaceful
      hearth, Grandfather put off the other events of the old French War till
      the next evening.

IN the twilight of the succeeding eve, when the red beams of the fire were
      dancing upon the wall, the children besought Grandfather to tell them what
      had next happened to the old chair.

“Our chair,” said Grandfather, “stood all this time in the Province House.
      But Governor Shirley had seldom an opportunity to repose within its arms.
      He was leading his troops through the forest, or sailing in a flat-boat on
      Lake Ontario, or sleeping in his tent, while the awful cataract of Niagara
      sent its roar through his dreams. At one period, in the early part of the
      war, Shirley had the chief command of all the king’s forces in America.”

“I rather imagine,” replied Grandfather, “that she remained in Boston.
      This lady, I suppose, had our chair all to herself, and used to sit in it
      during those brief intervals when a young Frenchwoman can be quiet enough
      to sit in a chair. The people of Massachusetts were never fond of Governor
      Shirley’s young French wife. They had a suspicion that she betrayed the
      military plans of the English to the generals of the French armies.”

“Probably not,” said Grandfather. “But the mere suspicion did Shirley a
      great deal of harm. Partly, perhaps, for this reason, but much more on
      account of his inefficiency as a general, he was deprived of his command
      in 1756, and recalled to England. He never afterwards made any figure in
      public life.”

As Grandfather’s chair had no locomotive properties, and did not even run
      on castors, it cannot be supposed to have marched in person to the old
      French War. But Grandfather delayed its momentous history while he touched
      briefly upon some of the bloody battles, sieges, and onslaughts, the
      tidings of which kept continually coming to the ears of the old
      inhabitants of Boston. The woods of the North were populous with fighting
      men. All the Indian tribes uplifted their tomahawks, and took part either
      with the French or English. The rattle of musketry and roar of cannon
      disturbed the ancient quiet of the forest, and actually drove the bears
      and other wild beasts to the more cultivated portion of the country in the
      vicinity of the seaports. The children felt as if they were transported
      back to those forgotten times, and that the couriers from the army, with
      the news of a battle lost or won, might even now be heard galloping
      through the streets. Grandfather told them about the battle of Lake George
      in 1755, when the gallant Colonel Williams, a Massachusetts officer, was
      slain, with many of his countrymen. But General Johnson and General Lyman,
      with their army, drove back the enemy and mortally wounded the French
      leader, who was called the Baron Dieskau. A gold watch, pilfered from the
      poor baron, is still in existence, and still marks each moment of time
      without complaining of weariness, although its hands have been in motion
      ever since the hour of battle.

In the first years of the war there were many disasters on the English
      side. Among these was the loss of Fort Oswego in 1756, and of Fort William
      Henry in the following year. But the greatest misfortune that befell the
      English during the whole war was the repulse of General Abercrombie, with
      his army, from the ramparts of Ticonderoga in 1758. He attempted to storm
      the walls; but a terrible conflict ensued, in which more than two thousand
      Englishmen and New-Englanders were killed or wounded. The slain soldiers
      now lie buried around that ancient fortress. When the plough passes over
      the soil, it turns up here and there a mouldering bone.

Up to this period, none of the English generals had shown any military
      talent. Shirley, the Earl of Loudon, and General Abercrombie had each held
      the chief command at different times; but not one of them had won a single
      important triumph for the British arms. This ill success was not owing to
      the want of means: for, in 1758, General Abercrombie had fifty thousand
      soldiers under his command. But the French general, the famous Marquis de
      Montcalm, possessed a great genius for war, and had something within him
      that taught him how battles were to be won.

At length, in 1759, Sir Jeffrey Amherst was appointed commander-in-chief
      of all the British forces in America. He was a man of ability and a
      skilful soldier. A plan was now formed for accomplishing that object which
      had so long been the darling wish of the New-Englanders, and which their
      fathers had so many times attempted. This was the conquest of Canada.

Three separate armies were to enter Canada from different quarters. One of
      the three, commanded by General Prideaux, was to embark on Lake Ontario
      and proceed to Montreal. The second, at the head of which was Sir Jeffrey
      Amherst himself, was destined to reach the river St. Lawrence by the way
      of Lake Champlain, and then go down the river to meet the third army. This
      last, led by General Wolfe, was to enter the St. Lawrence from the sea and
      ascend the river to Quebec. It is to Wolfe and his army that England owes
      one of the most splendid triumphs ever written in her history.

Grandfather described the siege of Quebec, and told how Wolfe led his
      soldiers up a rugged and lofty precipice, that rose from the shore of the
      river to the plain on which the city stood. This bold adventure was
      achieved in the darkness of night. At daybreak tidings were carried to the
      Marquis de Montcalm that the English army was waiting to give him battle
      on the Plains of Abraham. This brave French general ordered his drums to
      strike up, and immediately marched to encounter Wolfe.

He marched to his own death. The battle was the most fierce and terrible
      that had ever been fought in America. General Wolfe was at the head of his
      soldiers, and, while encouraging them onward, received a mortal wound. He
      reclined against a stone in the agonies of death; but it seemed as if his
      spirit could not pass away while the fight yet raged so doubtfully.
      Suddenly a shout came pealing across the battle-field. “They flee! they
      flee!” and, for a moment, Wolfe lifted his languid head. “Who flee?” he
      inquired.

“The French,” replied an officer. “Then I die satisfied!” said Wolfe, and
      expired in the arms of victory.

“If ever a warrior’s death were glorious, Wolfe’s was so,” said
      Grandfather; and his eye kindled, though he was a man of peaceful thoughts
      and gentle spirit. “His life-blood streamed to baptize the soil which he
      had added to the dominion of Britain. His dying breath was mingled with
      his army’s shout of victory.”

“Oh, it was a good death to die!” cried Charley, with glistening eyes.
      “Was it not a good death, Laurence?”

Laurence made no reply; for his heart burned within him, as the picture of
      Wolfe, dying on the blood-stained field of victory, arose to his
      imagination; and yet he had a deep inward consciousness that, after all,
      there was a truer glory than could thus be won.

“There were other battles in Canada after Wolfe’s victory,” resumed
      Grandfather; “but we may consider the old French War as having terminated
      with this great event. The treaty of peace, however, was not signed until
      1763. The terms of the treaty were very disadvantageous to the French; for
      all Canada, and all Acadia, and the Island of Cape Breton,—in short,
      all the territories that France and England had been fighting about for
      nearly a hundred years,—were surrendered to the English.”

Grandfather mentioned two other important events. The first was the great
      fire of Boston in 1760, when the glare from nearly three hundred
      buildings, all in flames at once, shone through the windows of the
      Province House, and threw a fierce lustre upon the gilded foliage and
      lion’s head of our old chair. The second event was the proclamation, in
      the same year, of George III. as King of Great Britain. The blast of the
      trumpet sounded from the balcony of the Town House, and awoke the echoes
      far and wide, as if to challenge all mankind to dispute King George’s
      title.

Seven times, as the successive monarchs of Britain ascended the throne,
      the trumpet peal of proclamation had been heard by those who sat in our
      venerable chair. But when the next king put on his father’s crown, no
      trumpet peal proclaimed it to New England. Long before that day America
      had shaken off the royal government.

NOW THAT Grandfather had fought through the old French War, in which our
      chair made no very distinguished figure, he thought it high time to tell
      the children some of the more private history of that praiseworthy old
      piece of furniture.

“In 1757,” said Grandfather, “after Shirley had been summoned to England,
      Thomas Pownall was appointed governor of Massachusetts. He was a gay and
      fashionable English gentleman, who had spent much of his life in London,
      but had a considerable acquaintance with America. The new governor appears
      to have taken no active part in the war that was going on; although, at
      one period, he talked of marching against the enemy at the head of his
      company of cadets. But, on the whole, he probably concluded that it was
      more befitting a governor to remain quietly in our chair, reading the
      newspapers and official documents.”

“They found no fault with him,” replied Grandfather. “It was no time to
      quarrel with the governor when the utmost harmony was required in order to
      defend the country against the French. But Pownall did not remain long in
      Massachusetts. In 1759 he was sent to be governor of South Carolina. In
      thus exchanging one government for another, I suppose he felt no regret,
      except at the necessity of leaving Grandfather’s chair behind him.”

“It appears to me,” said Laurence, giving the rein to his fancy, “that the
      fate of this ancient chair was, somehow or other, mysteriously connected
      with the fortunes of old Massachusetts. If Governor Pownall had put it
      aboard the vessel in which he sailed for South Carolina, she would
      probably have lain wind-bound in Boston Harbor. It was ordained that the
      chair should not be taken away. Don’t you think so, Grandfather?”

“It was kept here for Grandfather and me to sit in together,” said little
      Alice, “and for Grandfather to tell stories about.”

“And Grandfather is very glad of such a companion and such a theme,” said
      the old gentleman, with a smile. “Well, Laurence, if our oaken chair, like
      the wooden palladium of Troy, was connected with the country’s fate, yet
      there appears to have been no supernatural obstacle to its removal from
      the Province House. In 1760 Sir Francis Bernard, who had been’ governor of
      New Jersey, was appointed to the same office in Massachusetts. He looked
      at the old chair, and thought it quite too shabby to keep company with a
      new set of mahogany chairs and an aristocratic sofa which had just arrived
      from London. He therefore ordered it to be put away in the garret.”

The children were loud in their exclamations against this irreverent
      conduct of Sir Francis Bernard. But Grandfather defended him as well as he
      could. He observed that it was then thirty years since the chair had been
      beautified by Governor Belcher. Most of the gilding was worn off by the
      frequent scourings which it had undergone beneath the hands of a black
      slave. The damask cushion, once so splendid, was now squeezed out of all
      shape, and absolutely in tatters, so many were the ponderous gentlemen who
      had deposited their weight upon it during these thirty years.

Moreover, at a council held by the Earl of Loudon with the governors of
      New England in 1757, his lordship, in a moment of passion, had kicked over
      the chair with his military boot. By this unprovoked and unjustifiable
      act, our venerable friend had suffered a fracture of one of its rungs.

“But,” said Grandfather, “our chair, after all, was not destined to spend
      the remainder of its days in the inglorious obscurity of a garret. Thomas
      Hutchinson, Lieutenant-governor of the province, was told of Sir Francis
      Bernard’s design. This gentleman was more familiar with the history of New
      England than any other man alive. He knew all the adventures and
      vicissitudes through which the old chair had passed, and could have told
      as accurately as your own Grandfather who were the personages that had
      occupied it. Often, while visiting at the Province House, he had eyed the
      chair with admiration, and felt a longing desire to become the possessor
      of it. He now waited upon Sir Francis Bernard, and easily obtained leave
      to carry it home.”

“No,” answered Grandfather. “What Mr. Hutchinson desired was, to restore
      the chair as much as possible to its original aspect, such as it had
      appeared when it was first made out of the Earl of Lincoln’s oak-tree. For
      this purpose he ordered it to be well scoured with soap and sand and
      polished with wax, and then provided it with a substantial leather
      cush-ion. When all was completed to his mind he sat down in the old chair,
      and began to write his History of Massachusetts.”

“Oh, that was a bright thought in Mr. Hutchinson,” exclaimed Laurence.
      “And no doubt the dim figures of the former possessors of the chair
      flitted around him as he wrote, and inspired him with a knowledge of all
      that they had done and suffered while on earth.”

“Why, my dear Laurence,” replied Grandfather, smiling, “if Mr. Hutchinson
      was favored with ally such extraordinary inspiration, he made but a poor
      use of it in his history; for a duller piece of composition never came
      from any man’s pen. However, he was accurate, at least, though far from
      possessing the brilliancy or philosophy of Mr. Bancroft.”

“But if Hutchinson knew the history of the chair,” rejoined Laurence, “his
      heart must have been stirred by it.”

“It must, indeed,” said Grandfather. “It would be entertaining and
      instructive, at the present day, to imagine what were Mr. Hutchinson’s
      thoughts as he looked back upon the long vista of events with which this
      chair was so remarkably connected.”

And Grandfather allowed his fancy to shape out an image of
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, sitting in an evening reverie by his
      fireside, and meditating on the changes that had slowly passed around the
      chair.

A devoted Monarchist, Hutchinson would heave no sigh for the subversion of
      the original republican government, the purest that the world had seen,
      with which the colony began its existence. While reverencing the grim and
      stern old Puritans as the founders of his native land, he would not wish
      to recall them from their graves, nor to awaken again that king-resisting
      spirit which he imagined to be laid asleep with them forever. Winthrop,
      Dudley, Bellingham, Endicott, Leverett, and Bradstreet,—all these
      had had their day. Ages might come and go, but never again would the
      people’s suffrages place a republican governor in their ancient chair of
      state.

Coming down to the epoch of the second charter, Hutchinson thought of the
      ship-carpenter Phips springing from the lowest of the people and attaining
      to the loftiest station in the land. But he smiled to perceive that this
      governor’s example would awaken no turbulent ambition in the lower orders;
      for it was a king’s gracious boon alone that made the ship-carpenter a
      ruler. Hutchinson rejoiced to mark the gradual growth of an aristocratic
      class, to whom the common people, as in duty bound, were learning humbly
      to resign the honors, emoluments, and authority of state. He saw—or
      else deceived himself—that, throughout this epoch, the people’s
      disposition to self-government had been growing weaker through long
      disuse, and now existed only as a faint traditionary feeling.

The lieutenant-governor’s reverie had now come down to the period at which
      he himself was sitting in the historic chair. He endeavored to throw his
      glance forward over the coming years. There, probably, he saw visions of
      hereditary rank for himself and other aristocratic colonists. He saw the
      fertile fields of New England proportioned out among a few great
      landholders, and descending by entail from generation to generation. He
      saw the people a race of tenantry, dependent on their lords. He saw stars,
      garters, coronets, and castles.

“But,” added Grandfather, turning to Laurence, “the lieutenant-governor’s
      castles were built nowhere but among the red embers of the fire before
      which he was sitting. And, just as he had constructed a baronial residence
      for himself and his posterity, the fire rolled down upon the hearth and
      crumbled it to ashes!”

Grandfather now looked at his watch, which hung within a beautiful little
      ebony temple, supported by four Ionic columns. He then laid his hand on
      the golden locks of little Alice, whose head had sunk down upon the arm of
      our illustrious chair.

“To bed, to bed, dear child!” said he. “Grandfather has put you to sleep
      already by his stories about these FAMOUS OLD PEOPLE.”

AT a consultation, held between Colonel Winslow and Captain Murray, [of
      the New England forces, charged with the duty of exiling the Acadians,] it
      was agreed that a proclamation should be issued at the different
      settlements, requiring the attendance of the people at the respective
      posts on the same day; which proclamation should be so ambiguous in its
      nature that the object for which they were to assemble could not be
      discerned, and so peremptory in its terms as to ensure implicit obedience.
      This instrument, having been drafted and approved, was distributed
      according to the original plan. That which was addressed to the people
      inhabiting the country now comprised within the limits of King’s County,
      was as follows:—

“To the inhabitants of the District of Grand Pre, Minas, River Canard,
      &c.; as well ancient, as young men and lads:

“Whereas, his Excellency the Governor has instructed us of his late
      resolution, respecting the matter proposed to the inhabitants, and has
      ordered us to communicate the same in person, his Excellency being
      desirous that each of them should be fully satisfied of his Majesty’s
      intentions, which he has also ordered us to communicate to you, such as
      they have been given to him. We, therefore, order and strictly enjoin, by
      these presents, all of the inhabitants, as well of the above-named
      district as of all the other Districts, both old men and young men, as
      well as all the lads of ten years of age, to attend at the Church at Grand
      Pre, on Friday, the fifth instant, at three of the clock in the afternoon,
      that we may impart to them what we are ordered to communicate to them;
      declaring that no excuse will be admitted on any pretence whatever, on
      pain of forfeiting goods and chattels, in default of real estate. Given at
      Grand Pre, 2d September, 1755, and 29th year of his Majesty’s Reign.

In obedience to this summons four hundred and eighteen able-bodied men
      assembled. These being shut into the church (for that, too, had become an
      arsenal), Colonel Winslow placed himself, with his officers, in the
      centre, and addressed them thus:—

“I have received from his Excellency Governor Lawrence, the King’s
      Commission, which I have in my hand; and by his orders you are convened
      together to manifest to you, his Majesty’s final resolution to the French
      inhabitants of this his Province of Nova-Scotia; who, for almost half a
      century, have had more indulgence granted them than any of his subjects in
      any part of his dominions; what use you have made of it you yourselves
      best know. The part of duty I am now upon, though necessary, is very
      disagreeable to my natural make and temper, as I know it must be grievous
      to you, who are of the same species; but it is not my business to
      animadvert but to obey such orders as I receive, and therefore, without
      hesitation, shall deliver you his Majesty’s orders and instructions,
      namely—that your lands and tenements, cattle of all kinds and live
      stock of all sorts, are forfeited to the Crown; with all other your
      effects, saving your money and household goods, and you yourselves to be
      removed from this his Province.

“Thus it is peremptorily his Majesty’s orders that the whole French
      inhabitants of these Districts be removed; and I am, through his Majesty’s
      goodness, directed to allow you liberty to carry off your money and
      household goods, as many as you can without discommoding the vessels you
      go in. I shall do everything in my power that all those goods be secured
      to you, and that you are not molested in carrying them off; also, that
      whole families shall go in the same vessel, and make this remove, which I
      am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble, as easy as his
      Majesty’s service will admit; and hope that, in whatever part of the world
      you may fall, you may be faithful subjects, a peaceable and happy people.
      I must also inform you, that it is his Majesty’s pleasure that you remain
      in security under the inspection and direction of the troops that I have
      the honor to command.”

And he then declared them the King’s prisoners. The whole number of
      persons collected at Grand Pre finally amounted to four hundred and
      eighty-three men, and three hundred and thirty-seven women, heads of
      families; and their sons and daughters, to five hundred and twenty-seven
      of the former, and five hundred and seventy-six of the latter; making in
      the whole one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three souls. Their stock
      consisted of one thousand two hundred and sixty-nine oxen, one thousand
      five hundred and fifty-seven cows, five thousand and seven young cattle,
      four hundred and ninety-three horses, eight thousand six hundred and
      ninety sheep, and four thousand one hundred and ninety-seven hogs. As some
      of these wretched inhabitants escaped to the woods, all possible measures
      were adopted to force them back to captivity. The country was laid waste
      to prevent their subsistence. In the District of Minas alone, there were
      destroyed two hundred and fifty-five houses, two hundred and seventy-six
      barns, one hundred and fifty-five outhouses, eleven mills, and one church;
      and the friends of those who refused to surrender were threatened as the
      victims of their obstinacy.

In short, so operative were the terrors that surrounded them, that of
      twenty-four young men, who deserted from a transport, twenty-two were glad
      to return of themselves, the others being shot by sentinels; and one of
      their friends, who was supposed to have been accessory to their escape,
      was carried on shore to behold the destruction of his house and effects,
      which were burned in his presence, as a punishment for his temerity and
      perfidious aid to his comrades. The prisoners expressed the greatest
      concern at having incurred his Majesty’s displeasure, and in a petition
      addressed to Colonel Winslow intreated him to detain a part of them as
      sureties for the appearance of the rest, who were desirous of visiting
      their families, and consoling them in their distress and misfortunes. To
      comply with this request of holding a few as hostages for the surrender of
      the whole body, was deemed inconsistent with his instructions; but, as
      there could be no objection to allow a small number of them to return to
      their homes, permission was given to them to choose ten for the District
      of Minas (Horton) and ten for the District of Canard (Cornwallis) to whom
      leave of absence was given for one day, and on whose return a similar
      number were indulged in the same manner. They bore their confinement, and
      received their sentence with a fortitude and resignation altogether
      unexpected; but when the hour of embarkation arrived, in which they were
      to leave the land of their nativity forever—to part with their
      friends and relatives, without the hope of ever seeing them again, and to
      be dispersed among strangers, whose language, customs and religion were
      opposed to their own, the weakness of human nature prevailed, and they
      were overpowered with the sense of their miseries. The preparations having
      been all completed, the 10th of September was fixed upon as the day of
      departure. The prisoners were drawn up six deep, and the young men, one
      hundred and sixty-one in number, were ordered to go first on board of the
      vessels. This they instantly and peremptorily refused to do, declaring
      that they would not leave their parents; but expressed a willingness to
      comply with the order, provided they were permitted to embark with their
      families. This request was immediately rejected, and the troops were
      ordered to fix bayonets and advance towards the prisoners, a motion which
      had the effect of producing obedience on the part of the young men, who
      forthwith commenced their march. The road from the chapel to the shore,
      just one mile in length, was crowded with women and children; who, on
      their knees, greeted them as they passed with their tears and their
      blessings, while the prisoners advanced with slow and reluctant steps,
      weeping, praying, and singing hymns. This detachment was followed by the
      seniors, who passed through the same scene of sorrow and distress. In this
      manner was the whole male part of the population of the District of Minas
      put on board the five transports, stationed in the river Gaspereaux, each
      vessel being guarded by six non-commissioned officers, and eighty
      privates. As soon as the other vessels arrived, their wives and children
      followed, and the whole were transported from Nova Scotia. The haste with
      which these measures were carried into execution did not admit of those
      preparations for their comfort, which, if unmerited by their disloyalty,
      were at least due in pity to the severity of their punishment. The hurry,
      confusion, and excitement connected with the embarkation had scarcely
      subsided, when the Provincials were appalled by the work of their own
      hands The novelty and peculiarity of their situation could not but force
      itself upon the attention of even the unreflecting soldiery; stationed in
      the midst of a beautiful and fertile country, they suddenly found
      themselves without a foe to subdue, and without a population to protect.
      The volumes of smoke which the half expiring embers emitted, while they
      marked the site of the peasant’s humble cottage, bore testimony to the
      extent of the work of destruction. For several successive evenings the
      cattle assembled round the smouldering ruins, as if in anxious expectation
      of the return of their masters, while all night long the faithful
      watchdogs of the Neutrals howled over the scene of desolation, and mourned
      alike the hand that had fed, and the house that had sheltered them.

ON THE evening of New-Year’s Day Grandfather was walking to and fro across
      the carpet, listening to the rain which beat hard against the curtained
      windows. The riotous blast shook the casement as if a strong man were
      striving to force his entrance into the comfortable room. With every puff
      of the wind the fire leaped upward from the hearth, laughing and rejoicing
      at the shrieks of the wintry storm.

Meanwhile Grandfather’s chair stood in its customary place by the
      fireside. The bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its oaken
      back, and shone through the open work, so that a complete pattern was
      thrown upon the opposite side of the room. Sometimes, for a moment or two,
      the shadow remained immovable, as if it were painted on the wall. Then all
      at once it began to quiver, and leap, and dance with a frisky motion.
      Anon, seeming to remember that these antics were unworthy of such a
      dignified and venerable chair, it suddenly stood still. But soon it began
      to dance anew.

And she ran to the wall and tried to catch hold of the flickering shadow;
      for, to children of five years old, a shadow seems almost as real as a
      substance.

If the children had been looking at Grandfather, they would have noticed
      that he paused in his walk across the room when Clara made this remark.
      The kind old gentleman was ready and willing to resume his stories of
      departed times. But he had resolved to wait till his auditors should
      request him to proceed, in order that they might find the instructive
      history of the chair a pleasure, and not a task.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I am tired to death of this dismal rain and
      of hearing the wind roar in the chimney. I have had no good time all day.
      It would be better to hear stories about the chair than to sit doing
      nothing and thinking of nothing.”

To say the truth, our friend Charley was very much out of humor with the
      storm, because it had kept him all day within doors, and hindered him from
      making a trial of a splendid sled, which Grandfather had given him for a
      New-Year’s gift. As all sleds, nowadays, must have a name, the one in
      question had been honored with the title of Grandfather’s chair, which was
      painted in golden letters on each of the sides. Charley greatly admired
      the construction of the new vehicle, and felt certain that it would
      outstrip any other sled that ever dashed adown the long slopes of the
      Common.

As for Laurence, he happened to be thinking, just at this moment, about
      the history of the chair. Kind old Grandfather had made him a present of a
      volume of engraved portraits, representing the features of eminent and
      famous people o f all countries. Among them Laurence found several who had
      formerly occupied our chair or been connected with its adventures. While
      Grandfather walked to and fro across the room, the imaginative boy was
      gazing at the historic chair. He endeavored to summon up the por-traits
      which he had seen in his volume, and to place them, like living figures,
      in the empty seat.

“The old chair has begun another year of its existence, to-day,” said
      Laurence. “We must make haste, or it will have a new history to be told
      before we finish the old one.”

“Yes, my children,” replied Grandfather, with a smile and a sigh, “another
      year has been added to those of the two centuries and upward which have
      passed since the Lady Arbella brought this chair over from England. It is
      three times as old as your Grandfather; but a year makes no impression on
      its oaken frame, while it bends the old man nearer and nearer to the
      earth; so let me go on with my stories while I may.”

Accordingly Grandfather came to the fireside and seated himself in the
      venerable chair. The lion’s head looked down with a grimly good-natured
      aspect as the children clustered around the old gentleman’s knees. It
      almost seemed as if a real lion were peeping over the back of the chair,
      and smiling at the group of auditors with a sort of lion-like
      complaisance. Little Alice, whose fancy often inspired her with singular
      ideas, exclaimed that the lion’s head was nodding at her, and that it
      looked as if it were going to open its wide jaws and tell a story.

But as the lion’s head appeared to be in no haste to speak, and as there
      was no record or tradition of its having spoken during the whole existence
      of the chair, Grandfather did not consider it worth while to wait.

“CHARLEY, my boy,” said Grandfather, “do you remember who was the last
      occupant of the chair?”

“It was Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson,” answered Charley. “Sir Francis
      Bernard, the new governor, had given him the chair, instead of putting it
      away in the garret of the Province House. And when we took leave of
      Hutchinson he was sitting by his fireside, and thinking of the past
      adventures of the chair and of what was to come.”

“Very well,” said Grandfather; “and you recollect that this was in 1763,
      or thereabouts, at the close of the old French War. Now, that you may
      fully comprehend the remaining adventures of the chair, I must make some
      brief remarks on the situation and character of the New England colonies
      at this period.”

So Grandfather spoke of the earnest loyalty of our fathers during the old
      French War, and after the conquest of Canada had brought that war to a
      triumphant close.

The people loved and reverenced the King of England even more than if the
      ocean had not rolled its waves between him and them; for, at the distance
      of three thousand miles, they could not discover his bad qualities and
      imperfections. Their love was increased by the dangers which they had
      encountered in order to heighten his glory and extend his dominion.
      Throughout the war the American colonists had fought side by side with the
      soldiers of Old England; and nearly thirty thousand young men had laid
      down their lives for the honor of King George. And the survivors loved him
      the better because they had done and suffered so much for his sake.

But there were some circumstances that caused America to feel more
      independent of England than at an earlier period. Canada and Acadia had
      now become British provinces; and our fathers were no longer afraid of the
      bands of French and Indians who used to assault them in old times. For a
      century and a half this had been the great terror of New England. Now the
      old French soldier was driven from the North forever. And even had it been
      otherwise, the English colonies were growing so populous and powerful that
      they might have felt fully able to protect themselves without any help
      from England.

There were thoughtful and sagacious men, who began to doubt whether a
      great country like America would always be content to remain under the
      government of an island three thousand miles away. This was the more
      doubtful, because the English Parliament had long ago made laws which were
      intended to be very beneficial to England at the expense of America. By
      these laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for their
      own use, or to carry on trade with any nation but the English.

“Now,” continued Grandfather, “if King George III. and his counsellors had
      considered these things wisely, they would have taken another course than
      they did. But when they saw how rich and populous the colonies had grown,
      their first thought was how they might make more profit out of them than
      heretofore. England was enormously in debt at the close of the old French
      War; and it was pretended that this debt had been contracted for the
      defence of the American colonies, and that, therefore, a part of it ought
      to be paid by them.”

“Why, this was nonsense!” exclaimed Charley. “Did not our fathers spend
      their lives, and their money too, to get Canada for King George?”

“True, they did,” said Grandfather; “and they told the English rulers so.
      But the king and his ministers would not listen to good advice. In 1765
      the British Parliament passed a Stamp Act.”

“The Stamp Act,” replied Grandfather, “was a law by which all deeds,
      bonds, and other papers of the same kind were ordered to be marked with
      the king’s stamp; and without this mark they were declared illegal and
      void. Now, in order to get a blank sheet of paper with the king’s stamp
      upon it, people were obliged to pay threepence more than the actual value
      of the paper. And this extra sum of threepence was a tax, and was to be
      paid into the king’s treasury.”

“It was not for threepence, nor for any amount of money, that America
      quarrelled with England,” replied Grandfather; “it was for a great
      principle. The colonists were determined not to be taxed except by their
      own representatives. They said that neither the king and Parliament, nor
      any other power on earth, had a right to take their money out of their
      pockets unless they freely gave it. And, rather than pay threepence when
      it was unjustly demanded, they resolved to sacrifice all the wealth of the
      country, and their lives along with it. They therefore made a most
      stubborn resistance to the Stamp Act.”

“That was noble!” exclaimed Laurence. “I understand how it was. If they
      had quietly paid the tax of threepence, they would have ceased to be
      freemen, and would have become tributaries of England. And so they
      contended about a great question of right and wrong, and put everything at
      stake for it.”

“You are right, Laurence,” said Grandfather, “and it was really amazing
      and terrible to see what a change came over the aspect of the people the
      moment the English Parliament had passed this oppressive act. The former
      history of our chair, my children, has given you some idea of what a
      harsh, unyielding, stern set of men the old Puritans were. For a good many
      years back, however, it had seemed as if these characteristics were
      disappearing. But no sooner did England offer wrong to the colonies than
      the descendants of the early settlers proved that they had the same kind
      of temper as their forefathers. The moment before, New England appeared
      like a humble and loyal subject of the crown; the next instant, she showed
      the grim, dark features of an old king-resisting Puritan.”

Grandfather spoke briefly of the public measures that were taken in
      opposition to the Stamp Act. As this law affected all the American
      colonies alike, it naturally led them to think of consulting together is
      order to procure its repeal. For this purpose the Legislature of
      Massachusetts proposed that delegates from every colony should meet in
      Congress. Accordingly nine colonies, both Northern and Southern, sent
      delegates to the city of New York.

“No, Charley,” answered Grandfather; “a great deal of talking was yet to
      be done before England and America could come to blows. The Congress
      stated the rights and grievances of the colonists. They sent a humble
      petition to the king, and a memorial to the Parliament, beseeching that
      the Stamp Act might be repealed. This was all that the delegates had it in
      their power to do.”

“By no means,” replied Grandfather. “It was a most important and memorable
      event, this first coming together of the American people by their
      representatives from the North and South. If England had been wise, she
      would have trembled at the first word that was spoken in such an
      assembly.”

These remonstrances and petitions, as Grandfather observed, were the work
      of grave, thoughtful, and prudent men. Meantime the young and hot-headed
      people went to work in their own way. It is probable that the petitions of
      Congress would have had little or no effect on the British statesmen if
      the violent deeds of the American people had not shown how much excited
      the people were. LIBERTY TREE was soon heard of in England.

“It was an old elm-tree,” answered Grandfather, “which stood near the
      corner of Essex Street, opposite the Boylston Market. Under the spreading
      branches of this great tree the people used to assemble whenever they
      wished to express their feelings and opinions. Thus, after a while, it
      seemed as if the liberty of the country was connected with Liberty Tree.”

“It bore strange fruit, sometimes,” said Grandfather. “One morning in
      August, 1765, two figures were found hanging on the sturdy branches of
      Liberty Tree. They were dressed in square-skirted coats and small-clothes;
      and, as their wigs hung down over their faces, they looked like real men.
      One was intended to represent the Earl of Bute, who was supposed to have
      advised the king to tax America. The other was meant for the effigy of
      Andrew Oliver, a gentleman belonging to one of the most respectable
      families in Massachusetts.”

“The king had appointed him to be distributor of the stamps,” answered
      Grandfather. “Mr. Oliver would have made a great deal of money by this
      business. But the people frightened him so much by hanging him in effigy,
      and afterwards by breaking into his house, that he promised to have
      nothing to do with the stamps. And all the king’s friends throughout
      America were compelled to make the same promise.”

“LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON,” continued Grandfather, “now began to be
      unquiet in our old chair. He had formerly been much respected and beloved
      by the people, and had often proved himself a friend to their interests.
      But the time was come when he could not be a friend to the people without
      ceasing to be a friend to the king. It was pretty generally understood
      that Hutchinson would act according to the king’s wishes, right or wrong,
      like most of the other gentlemen who held offices under the crown.
      Besides, as he was brother-in-law of Andrew Oliver, the people now felt a
      particular dislike to him.”

“I should think,” said Laurence, “as Mr. Hutchinson had written the
      history of our Puritan forefathers, he would have known what the temper of
      the people was, and so have taken care not to wrong them.”

“He trusted in the might of the King of England,” replied Grandfather,
      “and thought himself safe under the shelter of the throne. If no dispute
      had arisen between the king and the people, Hutchinson would have had the
      character of a wise, good, and patriotic magistrate. But, from the time
      that he took part against the rights of his country, the people’s love and
      respect were turned to scorn and hatred, and he never had another hour of
      peace.”

In order to show what a fierce and dangerous spirit was now aroused among
      the inhabitants, Grandfather related a passage from history which we shall
      call The Hutchinson Mob.

On the evening of the 26th of August, 1765, a bonfire was kindled in King
      Street. It flamed high upward, and threw a ruddy light over the front of
      the Town House, on which was displayed a carved representation of the
      royal arms. The gilded vane of the cupola glittered in the blaze. The
      kindling of this bonfire was the well-known signal for the populace of
      Boston to assemble in the street.

Before the tar-barrels, of which the bonfire was made, were half burned
      out, a great crowd had come together. They were chiefly laborers and
      seafaring men, together with many young apprentices, and all those idle
      people about town who are ready for any kind of mischief. Doubtless some
      school-boys were among them.

While these rough figures stood round the blazing bonfire, you might hear
      them speaking bitter words against the high officers of the province.
      Governor Bernard, Hutchinson, Oliver, Storey, Hallowell, and other men
      whom King George delighted to honor, were reviled as traitors to the
      country. Now and then, perhaps, an officer of the crown passed along the
      street, wearing the gold-laced hat, white wig, and embroidered waistcoat
      which were the fashion of the day. But when the people beheld him they set
      up a wild and angry howl; and their faces had an evil aspect, which was
      made more terrible by the flickering blaze of the bonfire.

“I should like to throw the traitor right into that blaze!” perhaps one
      fierce rioter would say.

“Yes; and all his brethren too!” another might reply; “and the governor
      and old Tommy Hutchinson into the hottest of it!”

“And the Earl of Bute along with them!” muttered a third; “and burn the
      whole pack of them under King George’s nose! No matter if it singed him!”

Some such expressions as these, either shouted aloud or muttered under the
      breath, were doubtless heard in King Street. The mob, meanwhile, were
      growing fiercer and fiercer, and seemed ready even to set the town on fire
      for the sake of burning the king’s friends out of house and home. And yet,
      angry as they were, they sometimes broke into a loud roar of laughter, as
      if mischief and destruction were their sport.

But we must now leave the rioters for a time, and take a peep into the
      lieutenant-governor’s splendid mansion. It was a large brick house,
      decorated with Ionic pilasters, and stood in Garden Court Street, near the
      North Square.

While the angry mob in King Street were shouting his name,
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson sat quietly in Grandfather’s chair,
      unsuspicious of the evil that was about to fall upon his head. His beloved
      family were in the room with him. He had thrown off his embroidered coat
      and powdered wig, and had on a loose-flowing gown and purple-velvet cap.
      He had likewise laid aside the cares of state and all the thoughts that
      had wearied and perplexed him throughout the day.

Perhaps, in the enjoyment of his home, he had forgotten all about the
      Stamp Act, and scarcely remembered that there was a king, across the
      ocean, who had resolved to make tributaries of the New-Englanders.
      Possibly, too, he had forgotten his own ambition, and would not have
      exchanged his situation, at that moment, to be governor, or even a lord.

The wax candles were now lighted, and showed a handsome room, well
      provided with rich furniture. On the walls hung the pictures of
      Hutchinson’s ancestors, who had been eminent men in their day, and were
      honorably remembered in the history of the country. Every object served to
      mark the residence of a rich, aristocratic gentleman, who held himself
      high above the common people, and could have nothing to fear from them. In
      a corner of the room, thrown carelessly upon a chair, were the scarlet
      robes of the chief justice. This high office, as well as those of
      lieutenant-governor, councillor, and judge of probate, was filled by
      Hutchinson.

Who or what could disturb the domestic quiet of such a great and powerful
      personage as now sat in Grandfather’s chair?

The lieutenant-governor’s favorite daughter sat by his side. She leaned on
      the arm of our great chair, and looked up affectionately into her father’s
      face, rejoicing to perceive that a quiet smile was on his lips. But
      suddenly a shade came across her countenance. She seemed to listen
      attentively, as if to catch a distant sound.

The lieutenant-governor listened. But his ears were duller than those of
      his daughter; he could hear nothing more terrible than the sound of a
      summer breeze, sighing among the tops of the elm-trees.

“No, foolish child!” he replied, playfully patting her cheek. “There is no
      tumult. Our Boston mobs are satisfied with what mischief they have already
      done. The king’s friends need not tremble.”

So Hutchinson resumed his pleasant and peaceful meditations, and again
      forgot that there were any troubles in the world. But his family were
      alarmed, and could not help straining their ears to catch the slightest
      sound. More and more distinctly they heard shouts, and then the trampling
      of many feet. While they were listening, one of the neighbors rushed
      breathless into the room.

“A mob! a terrible mob’!” cried he. “They have broken into Mr. Storey’s
      house, and into Mr. Hallo-well’s, and have made themselves drunk with the
      liquors in his cellar; and now they are coming hither, as wild as so many
      tigers. Flee, lieutenant-governor, for your life! for your life!”

But Hutchinson would not hearken to them. He was an old lawyer; and he
      could not realize that the people would do anything so utterly lawless as
      to assault him in his peaceful home. He was one of King George’s chief
      officers and it would be an insult and outrage upon the king himself if
      the lieutenant-governor should suffer any wrong.

“Have no fears on my account,” said he, “I am perfectly safe. The king’s
      name shall be my protection.”

Yet he bade his family retire into one of the neighboring houses. His
      daughter would have remained; but he forced her away.

The huzzas and riotous uproar of the mob were now heard, close at hand.
      The sound was terrible, and struck Hutchinson with the same sort of dread
      as if an enraged wild beast had broken loose and were roaring for its
      prey. He crept softly to the window. There he beheld an immense concourse
      of people, filling all the street and rolling onward to his house. It was
      like a tempestuous flood, that had swelled beyond its bounds and would
      sweep everything before it. Hutchinson trembled; he felt, at that moment,
      that the wrath of the people was a thousand-fold more terrible than the
      wrath of a king.

That was a moment when a loyalist and an aristocrat like Hutchinson might
      have learned how powerless are kings, nobles, and great men, when the low
      and humble range themselves against them. King George could do nothing for
      his servant now. Had King George been there he could have done nothing for
      himself. If Hutchinson had understood this lesson, and remembered it, he
      need not, in after years, have been an exile from his native country, nor
      finally have laid his bones in a distant land.

There was now a rush against the doors of the house. The people sent up a
      hoarse cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor’s daughter, whom he
      had supposed to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw her
      arms around him. She had returned by a private entrance.

“Father, are you mad?” cried she. “Will the king’s name protect you now?
      Come with me, or they will have your life.”

“True,” muttered Hutchinson to himself; “what care these roarers for the
      name of king? I must flee, or they will trample me down on the floor of my
      own dwelling.”

Hurrying away, he and his daughter made their escape by the private
      passage at the moment when the rioters broke into the house. The foremost
      of them rushed up the staircase, and entered the room which Hutchinson had
      just quitted. There they beheld our good old chair facing them with quiet
      dignity, while the lion’s head seemed to move its jaws in the unsteady
      light of their torches. Perhaps the stately aspect of our venerable
      friend, which had stood firm through a century and a half of trouble,
      arrested them for an instant. But they were thrust forward by those
      behind, and the chair lay overthrown.

Then began the work of destruction. The carved and polished mahogany
      tables were shattered with heavy clubs and hewn to splinters with axes.
      The marble hearths and mantel-pieces were broken. The volumes of
      Hutchinson’s library, so precious to a studious man, were torn out of
      their covers, and the leaves sent flying out of the windows. Manuscripts,
      containing secrets of our country’s history, which are now lost forever,
      were scattered to the winds.

The old ancestral portraits, whose fixed countenances looked down on the
      wild scene, were rent from the walls. The mob triumphed in their downfall
      and destruction, as if these pictures of Hutchinson’s forefathers had
      committed the same offences as their descendant. A tall looking-glass,
      which had hitherto presented a reflection of the enraged and drunken
      multitude, was now smashed into a thousand fragments. We gladly dismiss
      the scene from the mirror of our fancy.

Before morning dawned the walls of the house were all that remained. The
      interior was a dismal scene of ruin. A shower pattered in at the broken
      windows; and when Hutchinson and his family returned, they stood shivering
      in the same room where the last evening had seen them so peaceful and
      happy.

“Grandfather,” said Laurence, indignantly, “if the people acted in this
      manner, they were not worthy of even so much liberty as the King of
      England was willing to allow them.”

“It was a most unjustifiable act, like many other popular movements at
      that time,” replied Grandfather. “But we must not decide against the
      justice of the people’s cause merely because an excited mob was guilty of
      outrageous violence. Besides, all these things were done in the first fury
      of resentment. Afterwards the people grew more calm, and were more
      influenced by the counsel of those wise and good men who conducted them
      safely and gloriously through the Revolution.”

Little Alice, with tears in her blue eyes, said that she hoped the
      neighbors had not let Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson and his family be
      homeless in the street, but had taken them into their houses and been kind
      to them. Cousin Clara, recollecting the perilous situation of our beloved
      chair, inquired what had become of it.

“Nothing was heard of our chair for some time afterwards,” answered
      Grandfather. “One day in September, the same Andrew Oliver, of whom I
      before told you, was summoned to appear at high noon under Liberty Tree.
      This was the strangest summons that had ever been heard of; for it was
      issued in the name of the whole people, who thus took upon themselves the
      authority of a sovereign power. Mr. Oliver dared not disobey. Accordingly,
      at the appointed hour he went, much against his will, to Liberty Tree.”

Here Charley interposed a remark that poor Mr. Oliver found but little
      liberty under Liberty Tree. Grandfather assented.

“It was a stormy day,” continued he. “The equinoctial gale blew violently,
      and scattered the yellow leaves of Liberty Tree all along the street. Mr.
      Oliver’s wig was dripping with water-drops; and he probably looked
      haggard, disconsolate, and humbled to the earth. Beneath the tree, in
      Grandfather’s chair,—our own venerable chair,—sat Mr. Richard
      Dana, a justice of the peace. He administered an oath to Mr. Oliver that
      he would never have anything to do with distributing the stamps. A vast
      concourse of people heard the oath, and shouted when it was taken.”

“There is something grand in this,” said Laurence. “I like it, because the
      people seem to have acted with thoughtfulness and dignity; and this proud
      gentleman, one of his Majesty’s high officers, was made to feel that King
      George could not protect him in doing wrong.”

“But it was a sad day for poor Mr. Oliver,” observed Grandfather. “From
      his youth upward it had probably been the great principle of his life to
      be faithful and obedient to the king. And now, in his old age, it must
      have puzzled and distracted him to find the sovereign people setting up a
      claim to his faith and obedience.”

Grandfather closed the evening’s conversation by saying that the
      discontent of America was so great, that, in 1766, the British Parliament
      was compelled to repeal the Stamp Act. The people made great rejoicings,
      but took care to keep Liberty Tree well pruned and free from caterpillars
      and canker-worms. They foresaw that there might yet be occasion for them
      to assemble under its far-projecting shadow.

THE NEXT evening, Clara, who remembered that our chair had been left
      standing in the rain under Liberty Tree, earnestly besought Grandfather to
      tell when and where it had next found shelter. Perhaps she was afraid that
      the venerable chair, by being exposed to the inclemency of a September
      gale, might get the rheumatism in its aged joints.

“The chair,” said Grandfather, “after the ceremony of Mr. Oliver’s oath,
      appears to have been quite forgotten by the multitude. Indeed, being much
      bruised and rather rickety, owing to the violent treatment it had suffered
      from the Hutchinson mob, most people would have thought that its days of
      usefulness were over. Nevertheless, it was conveyed away under cover of
      the night and committed to the care of a skilful joiner. He doctored our
      old friend so successfully, that, in the course of a few days, it made its
      appearance in the public room of the British Coffee Houses in King
      Street.”

“I know not,” answered Grandfather, “unless he considered it a dishonor
      and disgrace to the chair to have stood under Liberty Tree. At all events,
      he suffered it to remain at the British Coffee House, which was the
      principal hotel in Boston. It could not possibly have found a situation
      where it would be more in the midst of business and bustle, or would
      witness more important events, or be occupied by a greater variety of
      persons.”

Grandfather went on to tell the proceedings of the despotic king and
      ministry of England after the repeal of the Stamp Act. They could not bear
      to think that their right to tax America should be disputed by the people.
      In the year 1767, therefore, they caused Parliament to pass an act for
      laying a duty on tea and some other articles that were in general use.
      Nobody could now buy a pound of tea without paying a tax to King George.
      This scheme was pretty craftily contrived; for the women of America were
      very fond of tea, and did not like to give up the use of it.

But the people were as much opposed to this new act of Parliament as they
      had been to the Stamp Act. England, however, was determined that they
      should submit. In order to compel their obedience, two regiments,
      consisting of more than seven hundred British soldiers, were sent to
      Boston. They arrived in September, 1768, and were landed on Long Wharf.
      Thence they marched to the Common with loaded muskets, fixed bayonets, and
      great pomp and parade. So now, at last, the free town of Boston was
      guarded and overawed by redcoats as it had been in the days of old Sir
      Edmund Andros.

In the month of November more regiments arrived. There were now four
      thousand troops in Boston. The Common was whitened with their tents. Some
      of the soldiers were lodged in Faneuil Hall, which the inhabitants looked
      upon as a consecrated place, because it had been the scene of a great many
      meetings in favor of liberty. One regiment was placed in the Town House,
      which we now call the Old State House. The lower floor of this edifice had
      hitherto been used by the merchants as an exchange. In the upper stories
      were the chambers of the judges, the representatives, and the governor’s
      council. The venerable councillors could not assemble to consult about the
      welfare of the province without being challenged by sentinels and passing
      among the bayonets of the British soldiers.

Sentinels likewise were posted at the lodgings of the officers in many
      parts of the town. When the inhabitants approached they were greeted by
      the sharp question, “Who goes there?” while the rattle of the soldier’s
      musket was heard as he presented it against their breasts. There was no
      quiet even on the sabbath day. The quiet descendants of the Puritans were
      shocked by the uproar of military music; the drum, fife, and bugle
      drowning the holy organ peal and the voices of the singers. It would
      appear as if the British took every method to insult the feelings of the
      people.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, impatiently, “the people did not go to
      fighting half soon enough! These British redcoats ought to have been
      driven back to their vessels the very moment they landed on Long Wharf.”

“Many a hot-headed young man said the same as you do, Charley,” answered
      Grandfather. “But the elder and wiser people saw that the time was not yet
      come. Meanwhile, let us take another peep at our old chair.”

“Ah, it drooped its head, I know,” said Charley, “when it saw how the
      province was disgraced. Its old Puritan friends never would have borne
      such doings.”

“The chair,” proceeded Grandfather, “was now continually occupied by some
      of the high tories, as the king’s friends were called, who frequented the
      British Coffee House. Officers of the Custom House, too, which stood on
      the opposite side of King Street, often sat in the chair wagging their
      tongues against John Hancock.”

“Because he was a great merchant and contended against paying duties to
      the king,” said Grandfather.

“Well, frequently, no doubt, the officers of the British regiments, when
      not on duty, used to fling themselves into the arms of our venerable
      chair. Fancy one of them, a red-nosed captain in his scarlet uniform,
      playing with the hilt of his sword, and making a circle of his brother
      officers merry with ridiculous jokes at the expense of the poor Yankees.
      And perhaps he would call for a bottle of wine, or a steaming bowl of
      punch, and drink confusion to all rebels.”

“Our grave old chair must have been scandalized at such scenes,” observed
      Laurence; “the chair that had been the Lady Arbella’s, and which the holy
      apostle Eliot had consecrated.”

“It certainly was little less than sacrilege,” replied Grandfather; “but
      the time was coming when even the churches, where hallowed pastors had
      long preached the word of God, were to be torn down or desecrated by the
      British troops. Some years passed, however, before such things were done.”

Grandfather now told his auditors that, in 1769, Sir Francis Bernard went
      to England after having been governor of Massachusetts ten years. He was a
      gentleman of many good qualities, an excellent scholar, and a friend to
      learning. But he was naturally of an arbitrary disposition; and he had
      been bred at the University of Oxford, where young men were taught that
      the divine right of kings was the only thing to be regarded in matters of
      government. Such ideas were ill adapted to please the people of
      Massachusetts. They rejoiced to get rid of Sir Francis Bernard, but liked
      his successor, Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, no better than himself.

About this period the people were much incensed at an act committed by a
      person who held an office in the Custom House. Some lads, or young men,
      were snowballing his windows. He fired a musket at them, and killed a poor
      German boy, only eleven years old. This event made a great noise in town
      and country, and much increased the resentment that was already felt
      against the servants of the crown.

“Now, children,” said Grandfather, “I wish to make you comprehend the
      position of the British troops in King Street. This is the same which we
      now call State Street. On the south side of the Town House, or Old State
      House, was what military men call a court of guard, defended by two brass
      cannons, which pointed directly at one of the doors of the above edifice.
      A large party of soldiers were always stationed in the court of guard. The
      Custom House stood at a little distance down King Street, nearly where the
      Suffolk Bank now stands, and a sentinel was continually pacing before its
      front.”

“I shall remember this to-morrow,” said Charley; “and I will go to State
      Street, so as to see exactly where the British troops were stationed.”

“And before long,” observed Grandfather, “I shall have to relate an event
      which made King Street sadly famous on both sides of the Atlantic. The
      history of our chair will soon bring us to this melancholy business.”

Here Grandfather described the state of things which arose from the ill
      will that existed between the inhabitants and the redcoats. The old and
      sober part of the townspeople were very angry at the government for
      sending soldiers to overawe them. But those gray-headed men were cautious,
      and kept their thoughts and feelings in their own breasts, without putting
      themselves in the way of the British bayonets.

The younger people, however, could hardly be kept within such prudent
      limits. They reddened with wrath at the very sight of a soldier, and would
      have been willing to come to blows with them at any moment. For it was
      their opinion that every tap of a British drum, within the peninsula of
      Boston was an insult to the brave old town.

“It was sometimes the case,” continued Grandfather, “that affrays happened
      between such wild young men as these and small parties of the soldiers. No
      weapons had hitherto been used except fists or cudgels. But when men have
      loaded muskets in their hands, it is easy to foretell that they will soon
      be turned against the bosoms of those who provoke their anger.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, looking fearfully into his face, “your
      voice sounds as though you were going to tell us something awful!”

LITTLE ALICE, by her last remark, proved herself a good judge of what was
      expressed by the tones of Grandfather’s voice. He had given the above
      description of the enmity between the townspeople and the soldiers in
      order to Prepare the minds of his auditors for a very terrible event. It
      was one that did more to heighten the quarrel between England and America
      than anything that had yet occurred.

It was now the 8d of March, 1770. The sunset music of the British
      regiments was heard as usual throughout the town. The shrill fife and
      rattling drum awoke the echoes in King Street, while the last ray of
      sunshine was lingering on the cupola of the Town House. And now all the
      sentinels were posted. One of them marched up and down before the Custom
      House, treading a short path through the snow, and longing for the time
      when he would be dismissed to the warm fireside of the guard room.
      Meanwhile Captain Preston was, perhaps, sitting in our great chair before
      the hearth of the British Coffee House. In the course of the evening there
      were two or three slight commotions, which seemed to indicate that trouble
      was at hand. Small parties of young men stood at the corners of the
      streets or walked along the narrow pavements. Squads of soldiers who were
      dismissed from duty passed by them, shoulder to shoulder, with the regular
      step which they had learned at the drill. Whenever these encounters took
      place, it appeared to be the object of the young men to treat the soldiers
      with as much incivility as possible.

“Turn out, you lobsterbacks!” one would say. “Crowd them off the
      sidewalks!” another would cry. “A redcoat has no right in Boston streets!”

“O, you rebel rascals!” perhaps the soldiers would reply, glaring fiercely
      at the young men. “Some day or other we’ll make our way through Boston
      streets at the point of the bayonet!”

Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle; which passed
      off, however, without attracting much notice. About eight o’clock, for
      some unknown cause, an alarm-bell rang loudly and hurriedly.

At the sound many people ran out of their houses, supposing it to be an
      alarm of fire. But there were no flames to be seen, nor was there any
      smell of smoke in the clear, frosty air; so that most of the townsmen went
      back to their own firesides and sat talking with their wives and children
      about the calamities of the times. Others who were younger and less
      prudent remained in the streets; for there seems to have been a
      presentiment that some strange event was on the eve of taking place.

Later in the evening, not far from nine o’clock, several young men passed
      by the Town House and walked down King Street. The sentinel was still on
      his post in front of the Custom House, pacing to and fro; while, as he
      turned, a gleam of light from some neighboring window glittered on the
      barrel of his musket. At no great distance were the barracks and the
      guard-house, where his comrades were probably telling stories of battle
      and bloodshed.

Down towards the Custom House, as I told you, came a party of wild young
      men. When they drew near the sentinel he halted on his post, and took his
      musket from his shoulder, ready to present the bayonet at their breasts.

“Who goes there?” he cried, in the gruff, peremptory tones of a soldier’s
      challenge. The young men, being Boston boys, felt as if they had a right
      to walk their own streets without being accountable to a British redcoat,
      even though he challenged them in King George’s name. They made some rude
      answer to the sentinel. There was a dispute, or perhaps a scuffle. Other
      soldiers heard the noise, and ran hastily from the barracks to assist
      their comrades. At the same time many of the townspeople rushed into King
      Street by various avenues, and gathered in a crowd round about the Custom
      House. It seemed wonderful how such a multitude had started up all of a
      sudden.

The wrongs and insults which the people had been suffering for many months
      now kindled them into a rage. They threw snowballs and lumps of ice at the
      soldiers. As the tumult grew louder it reached the ears of Captain
      Preston, the officer of the day. He immediately ordered eight soldiers of
      the main guard to take their muskets and follow him. They marched across
      the street, forcing their way roughly through the crowd, and pricking the
      townspeople with their bayonets.

A gentleman (it was Henry Knox, afterwards general of the American
      artillery) caught Captain Preston’s arm.

“Stand aside!” answered Captain Preston, haughtily. “Do not interfere,
      sir. Leave me to manage the affair.”

Arriving at the sentinel’s post, Captain Preston drew up his men in a
      semicircle, with their faces to the crowd and their rear to the Custom
      House. When the people saw the officer and beheld the threatening attitude
      with which the soldiers fronted them, their rage became almost
      uncontrollable.

“Rush upon them!” shouted many voices. “Drive the rascals to their
      barracks! Down with them! Down with them! Let them fire if they dare!”

Amid the uproar, the soldiers stood glaring at the people with the
      fierceness of men whose trade was to shed blood.

Oh, what a crisis had now arrived! Up to this very moment, the angry
      feelings between England and America might have been pacified. England had
      but to stretch out the hand of reconciliation, and acknowledge that she
      had hitherto mistaken her rights, but would do so no more. Then the
      ancient bonds of brotherhood would again have been knit together as firmly
      as in old times. The habit of loyalty, which had grown as strong as
      instinct, was not utterly overcome. The perils shared, the victories won,
      in the old French War, when the soldiers of the colonies fought side by
      side with their comrades from beyond the sea, were unforgotten yet.
      England was still that beloved country which the colonists called their
      home. King George, though he had frowned upon America, was still
      reverenced as a father.

But should the king’s soldiers shed one drop of American blood, then it
      was a quarrel to the death. Never, never would America rest satisfied
      until she had torn down the royal authority and trampled it in the dust.

“Fire, if you dare, villains!” hoarsely shouted the people, while the
      muzzles of the muskets were turned upon them. “You dare not fire!”

They appeared ready to rush upon the levelled bayonets. Captain Preston
      waved his sword, and uttered a command which could not be distinctly heard
      amid the uproar of shouts that issued from a hundred throats. But his
      soldiers deemed that he had spoken the fatal mandate, “Fire!” The flash of
      their muskets lighted up the streets, and the report rang loudly between
      the edifices. It was said, too, that the figure of a man, with a cloth
      hanging down over his face, was seen to step into the balcony of the
      Custom House and discharge a musket at the crowd.

A gush of smoke had overspread the scene. It rose heavily, as if it were
      loath to reveal the dreadful spectacle beneath it. Eleven of the sons of
      New England lay stretched upon the street. Some, sorely wounded, were
      struggling to rise again. Others stirred not nor groaned; for they were
      past all pain. Blood was streaming upon the snow; and that purple stain in
      the midst of King Street, though it melted away in the next day’s sun, was
      never forgotten nor forgiven by the people.

Grandfather was interrupted by the violent sobs of little Alice. In his
      earnestness he had neglected to soften clown the narrative so that it
      might not terrify the heart of this unworldly infant. Since Grandfather
      began the history of our chair, little Alice had listened to many tales of
      war. But probably the idea had never really impressed itself upon her mind
      that men have shed the blood of their fellow-creatures. And now that this
      idea was forcibly presented to her, it affected the sweet child with
      bewilderment and horror.

“I ought to have remembered our dear little Alice,” said Grandfather
      reproachfully to himself. “Oh, what a pity! Her heavenly nature has now
      received its first impression of earthly sin and violence. Well, Clara,
      take her to bed and comfort her. Heaven grant that she may dream away the
      recollection of the Boston massacre!”

“Grandfather,” said Charley, when Clara and little Alice had retired, “did
      not the people rush upon the soldiers and take revenge?”

“The town drums beat to arms,” replied Grandfather, “the alarm-bells rang,
      and an immense multitude rushed into King Street. Many of them had weapons
      in their hands. The British prepared to defend themselves. A whole
      regiment was drawn up in the street, expecting an attack; for the townsmen
      appeared ready to throw themselves upon the bayonets.”

“Governor Hutchinson hurried to the spot,” said Grandfather, “and besought
      the people to have patience, promising that strict justice should be done.
      A day or two afterward the British troops were withdrawn from town and
      stationed at Castle William. Captain Preston and the eight soldiers were
      tried for murder. But none of them were found guilty. The judges told the
      jury that the insults and violence which had been offered to the soldiers
      justified them in firing at the mob.”

“The Revolution,” observed Laurence, who had said but little during the
      evening, “was not such a calm, majestic movement as I supposed. I do not
      love to hear of mobs and broils in the street. These things were unworthy
      of the people when they had such a great object to accomplish.”

“Nevertheless, the world has seen no grander movement than that of our
      Revolution from first to last,” said Grandfather. “The people, to a man,
      were full of a great and noble sentiment. True, there may be much fault to
      find with their mode of expressing this sentiment; but they knew no
      better; the necessity was upon them to act out their feelings in the best
      manner they could. We must forgive what was wrong in their actions, and
      look into their hearts and minds for the honorable motives that impelled
      them.”

“And I suppose,” said Laurence, “there were men who knew how to act
      worthily of what they felt.”

Grandfather here made a pause. That night Charley had a dream about the
      Boston massacre, and thought that he himself was in the crowd and struck
      down Captain Preston with a great club. Laurence dreamed that he was
      sitting in our great chair, at the window of the British Coffee House, and
      beheld the whole scene which Grandfather had described. It seemed to him,
      in his dream, that, if the townspeople and the soldiers would but have
      heard him speak a single word, all the slaughter might have been averted.
      But there was such an uproar that it drowned his voice.

The next morning the two boys went together to State Street and stood on
      the very spot where the first blood of the Revolution had been shed. The
      Old State House was still there, presenting almost the same aspect that it
      had worn on that memorable evening, one-and-seventy years ago. It is the
      sole remaining witness of the Boston massacre.

THE NEXT evening the astral lamp was lighted earlier than usual, because
      Laurence was very much engaged in looking over the collection of portraits
      which had been his New-Year’s gift from Grandfather.

Among them he found the features of more than one famous personage who had
      been connected with the adventures of our old chair. Grandfather bade him
      draw the table nearer to the fireside; and they looked over the portraits
      together, while Clara and Charley likewise lent their attention. As for
      little Alice, she sat in Grandfather’s lap, and seemed to see the very men
      alive whose faces were there represented.

Turning over the volume, Laurence came to the portrait of a stern,
      grim-looking man, in plain attire, of much more modern fashion than that
      of the old Puritans. But the face might well have befitted one of those
      iron-hearted men. Beneath the portrait was the name of Samuel Adams.

“He was a man of great note in all the doings that brought about the
      Revolution,” said Grandfather. “His character was such, that it seemed as
      if one of the ancient Puritans had been sent back to earth to animate the
      people’s hearts with the same abhorrence of tyranny that had distinguished
      the earliest settlers. He was as religious as they, as stern and
      inflexible, and as deeply imbued with democratic principles. He, better
      than any one else, may be taken as a representative of the people of New
      England, and of the spirit with which they engaged in the Revolutionary
      struggle. He was a poor man, and earned his bread by a humble occupation;
      but with his tongue and pen he made the King of England tremble on his
      throne. Remember him, my children, as one of the strong men of our
      country.”

“Here is one whose looks show a very different character,” observed
      Laurence, turning to the portrait of John Hancock. “I should think, by his
      splendid dress and courtly aspect, that he was one of the king’s friends.”

“There never was a greater contrast than between Samuel Adams and John
      Hancock,” said Grandfather. “Yet they were of the same side in politics,
      and had an equal agency in the Revolution. Hancock was born to the
      inheritance of the largest fortune in New England. His tastes and habits
      were aristocratic. He loved gorgeous attire, a splendid mansion,
      magnificent furniture, stately festivals, and all that was glittering and
      pompous in external things. His manners were so polished that there stood
      not a nobleman at the footstool of King George’s throne who was a more
      skilful courtier than John Hancock might have been. Nevertheless, he in
      his embroidered clothes, and Samuel Adams in his threadbare coat, wrought
      together in the cause of liberty. Adams acted from pure and rigid
      principle. Hancock, though he loved his country, yet thought quite as much
      of his own popularity as he did of the people’s rights. It is remarkable
      that these two men, so very different as I describe them, were the only
      two exempted from pardon by the king’s proclamation.”

On the next leaf of the book was the portrait of General Joseph Warren.
      Charley recognized the name, and said that here was a greater man than
      either Hancock or Adams.

“Warren was an eloquent and able patriot,” replied Grandfather. “He
      deserves a lasting memory for his zealous efforts in behalf of liberty. No
      man’s voice was more powerful in Faneuil Hall than Joseph Warren’s. If his
      death had not happened so early in the contest, he would probably have
      gained a high name as a soldier.”

The next portrait was a venerable man, who held his thumb under his chin,
      and, through his spectacles, appeared to be attentively reading a
      manuscript.

“Here we see the most illustrious Boston boy that ever lived,” said
      Grandfather. “This is Benjamin Franklin. But I will not try to compress
      into a few sentences the character of the sage, who, as a Frenchman
      expressed it, snatched the lightning from the sky and the sceptre from a
      tyrant. Mr. Sparks must help you to the knowledge of Franklin.”

The book likewise contained portraits of James Otis and Josiah Quincy.
      Both of them, Grandfather observed, were men of wonderful talents and true
      patriotism. Their voices were like the stirring tones of a trumpet
      arousing the country to defend its freedom. Heaven seemed to have provided
      a greater number of eloquent men than had appeared at any other period, in
      order that the people might be fully instructed as to their wrongs and the
      method of resistance.

“It is marvellous,” said Grandfather, “to see how many powerful writers,
      orators, and soldiers started up just at the time when they were wanted.
      There was a man for every kind of work. It is equally wonderful that men
      of such different characters were all made to unite in the one object of
      establishing the freedom and independence of America. There was an
      over-ruling Providence above them.”

“Yes; an earnest, warm-tempered, honest and most able man,” said
      Grandfather. “At the period of which we are now speaking he was a lawyer
      in Boston. He was destined in after years to be ruler over the whole
      American people, whom he contributed so much to form into a nation.”

Grandfather here remarked that many a New-Englander, who had passed his
      boyhood and youth in obscurity, afterward attained to a fortune which he
      never could have foreseen even in his most ambitious dreams. John Adams,
      the second President of the United States and the equal of crowned kings,
      was once a schoolmaster and country lawyer. Hancock, the first signer of
      the Declaration of Independence, served his apprenticeship with a
      merchant. Samuel Adams, afterwards governor of Massachusetts, was a small
      tradesman and a tax-gatherer. General Warren was a physician, General
      Lincoln a farmer, and General Knox a bookbinder. General Nathaniel Greene,
      the best soldier, except Washington, in the Revolutionary army, was a
      Quaker and a blacksmith. All these became illustrious men, and can never
      be forgotten in American history.

“And any boy who is born in America may look forward to the same things,”
       said our ambitious friend Charley.

After these observations, Grandfather drew the book of portraits towards
      him and showed the children several British peers and members of
      Parliament who had exerted themselves either for or against the rights of
      America. There were the Earl of Bute, Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. These
      were looked upon as deadly enemies to our country.

Among the friends of America was Mr. Pitt, afterward Earl of Chatham, who
      spent so much of his wondrous eloquence in endeavoring to warn England of
      the consequences of her injustice. He fell down on the floor of the House
      of Lords after uttering almost his dying words in defence of our
      privileges as freemen. There was Edmund Burke, one of the wisest men and
      greatest orators that ever the world produced. There was Colonel Barry,
      who had been among our fathers, and knew that they had courage enough to
      die for their rights. There was Charles James Fox, who never rested until
      he had silenced our enemies in the House of Commons.

“It is very remarkable to observe how many of the ablest orators in the
      British Parliament were favorable to America,” said Grandfather. “We ought
      to remember these great Englishmen with gratitude; for their speeches
      encouraged our fathers almost as much as those of our own orators in
      Faneuil Hall and under Liberty Tree. Opinions which might have been
      received with doubt, if expressed only by a native American, were set down
      as true, beyond dispute, when they came from the lips of Chatham, Burke,
      Barre, or Fox.”

“But, Grandfather,” asked Lawrence, “were there no able and eloquent men
      in this country who took the part of King George?”

“There were many men of talent who said what they could in defence of the
      king’s tyrannical proceedings,” replied Grandfather. “But they had the
      worst side of the argument, and therefore seldom said anything worth
      remembering. Moreover, their hearts were faint and feeble; for they felt
      that the people scorned and detested them. They had no friends, no
      defence, except in the bayonets of the British troops. A blight fell upon
      all their faculties, because they were contending against the rights of
      their own native land.”

“Governor Hutchinson, Chief Justice Oliver, Judge Auchmuty, the Rev.
      Mather Byles, and several other clergymen, were among the most noted
      loyalists,” answered Grandfather.

“That wish is very wrong, Charley,” said Grandfather. “You must not think
      that there is no integrity and honor except among those who stood up for
      the freedom of America. For aught I know, there was quite as much of these
      qualities on one side as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a
      faithful adherence to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that
      principle of loyalty which made the royalists give up country, friends,
      fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a mistaken
      principle; but many of them cherished it honorably, and were martyrs to
      it.”

“And I would risk my life rather than one of those good old royalists
      should be tarred and feathered.”

“The time is now come when we may judge fairly of them,” continued
      Grandfather. “Be the good and true men among them honored; for they were
      as much our countrymen as the patriots were. And, thank Heaven, our
      country need not be ashamed of her sons,—of most of them at least,—whatever
      side they took in the Revolutionary contest.”

Among the portraits was one of King George III Little Alice clapped her
      hands, and seemed pleased with the bluff good-nature of his physiognomy.
      But Laurence thought it strange that a man with such a face, indicating
      hardly a common share of intellect, should have had influence enough on
      human affairs to convulse the world with war. Grandfather observed that
      this poor king had always appeared to him one of the most unfortunate
      persons that ever lived. He was so honest and conscientious, that, if he
      had been only a private man, his life would probably have been blameless
      and happy. But his was that worst of fortunes,—to be placed in a
      station far beyond his abilities.

“And so,” said Grandfather, “his life, while he retained what intellect
      Heaven had gifted him with, was one long mortification. At last he grew
      crazed with care and trouble. For nearly twenty years the men arch of
      England was confined as a madman. In his old age, too, God took away his
      eyesight; so that his royal palace was nothing to him but a dark, lonesome
      prison-house.”

“OUR old chair?” resumed Grandfather, “did not now stand in the midst of a
      gay circle of British officers. The troops, as I told you, had been
      removed to Castle William immediately after the Boston massacre. Still,
      however, there were many tories, custom-house officers, and Englishmen who
      used to assemble in the British Coffee House and talk over the affairs of
      the period. Matters grew worse and worse; and in 1773 the people did a
      deed which incensed the king and ministry more than any of their former
      doings.”

Grandfather here described the affair, which is known by the name of the
      Boston Tea Party. The Americans, for some time past, had left off
      importing tea, on account of the oppressive tax. The East India Company,
      in London, had a large stock of tea on hand, which they had expected to
      sell to the Americans, but could find no market for it. But after a while,
      the government persuaded this company of merchants to send the tea to
      America.

“How odd it is,” observed Clara, “that the liberties of America should
      have had anything to do with a cup of tea!”

Grandfather smiled, and proceeded with his narrative. When the people of
      Boston heard that several cargoes of tea were coming across the Atlantic,
      they held a great many meetings at Faneuil Hall, in the Old South Church,
      and under Liberty Tree. In the midst of their debates, three ships arrived
      in the harbor with the tea on board. The people spent more than a
      fortnight in consulting what should be done. At last, on the 16th of
      December, 1773, they demanded of Governor Hutchinson that he should
      immediately send the ships back to England.

The governor replied that the ships must not leave the harbor until the
      custom-house duties upon the tea should be paid. Now, the payment of these
      duties was the very thing against which the people had set their faces;
      because it was a tax unjustly imposed upon America by the English
      government. Therefore, in the dusk of the evening, as soon as Governor
      Hutchinson’s reply was received, an immense crowd hastened to Griffin’s
      Wharf, where the tea-ships lay. The place is now called Liverpool Wharf.

“When the crowd reached the wharf,” said Grandfather, “they saw that a set
      of wild-looking figures were already on board of the ships. You would have
      imagined that the Indian warriors of old times had come back again; for
      they wore the Indian dress, and had their faces covered with red and black
      paint, like the Indians when they go to war. These grim figures hoisted
      the tea-chests on the decks of the vessels; broke them open, and threw all
      the contents into the harbor.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, “I suppose Indians don’t love tea; else
      they would never waste it so.”

“They were not real Indians, my child,” answered Grandfather. “They were
      white men in disguise; because a heavy punishment would have been
      inflicted on them if the king’s officers had found who they were. But it
      was never known. From that day to this, though the matter has been talked
      of by all the world, nobody can tell the names of those Indian figures.
      Some people say that there were very famous men among them, who afterwards
      became governors and generals. Whether this be true I cannot tell.”

When tidings of this bold deed were carried to England, King George was
      greatly enraged. Parliament immediately passed an act, by which all
      vessels were forbidden to take in or discharge their cargoes at the port
      of Boston. In this way they expected to ruin all the merchants, and starve
      the poor people, by depriving them of employment. At the same time another
      act was passed, taking away many rights and privileges which had been
      granted in the charter of Massachusetts.

Governor Hutchinson, soon afterward, was summoned to England, in order
      that he might give his advice about the management of American affairs.
      General Gage, an officer of the old French War, and since
      commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed
      governor in his stead. One of his first acts was to make Salem, instead of
      Boston, the metropolis of Massachusetts, by summoning the General Court to
      meet there.

According to Grandfather’s description, this was the most gloomy time that
      Massachusetts had ever seen. The people groaned under as heavy a tyranny
      as in the days of Sir Edmund Andros. Boston looked as if it were afflicted
      with some dreadful pestilence,—so sad were the inhabitants, and so
      desolate the streets. There was no cheerful hum of business. The merchants
      shut up their warehouses, and the laboring men stood idle about the
      wharves. But all America felt interested in the good town of Boston; and
      contributions were raised, in many places, for the relief of the poor
      inhabitants.

“Oh,” replied Grandfather, “a gay throng of officers had now come back to
      the British Coffee House; so that the old chair had no lack of mirthful
      company. Soon after General Gage became governor a great many troops had
      arrived, and were encamped upon the Common. Boston was now a garrisoned
      and fortified town; for the general had built a battery across the Neck,
      on the road to Roxbury, and placed guards for its defence. Everything
      looked as if a civil war were close at hand.”

“A Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia,” said Grandfather, “and
      proposed such measures as they thought most conducive to the public good.
      A Provincial Congress was likewise chosen in Massachusetts. They exhorted
      the people to arm and discipline themselves. A great number of minutemen
      were enrolled. The Americans called them minute-men, because they engaged
      to be ready to fight at a minute’s warning. The English officers laughed,
      and said that the name was a very proper one, because the minute-men would
      run away the minute they saw the enemy. Whether they would fight or run
      was soon to be proved.”

Grandfather told the children that the first open resistance offered to
      the British troops, in the province of Massachusetts, was at Salem.
      Colonel Timothy Pickering, with thirty or forty militia-men, prevented the
      English colonel, Leslie, with four times as many regular soldiers, from
      taking possession of some military stores. No blood was shed on this
      occasion; but soon afterward it began to flow.

General Gage sent eight hundred soldiers to Concord, about eighteen miles
      from Boston, to destroy some ammunition and provisions which the colonists
      had collected there. They set out on their march on the evening of the
      18th of April, 1775. The next morning the general sent Lord’ Percy with
      nine hundred men to strengthen the troops that had gone before. All that
      day the inhabitants of Boston heard various rumors. Some said that the
      British were making great slaughter among our countrymen. Others affirmed
      that every man had turned out with his musket, and that not a single
      soldier would ever get back to Boston.

“It was after sunset,” continued Grandfather, “when the troops, who had
      marched forth so proudly, were seen entering Charlestown. They were
      covered with dust, and so hot and weary that their tongues hung out of
      their mouths. Many of them were faint with wounds. They had not all
      returned. Nearly three hundred were strewn, dead or dying, along the road
      from Concord. The yeomanry had risen upon the invaders and driven them
      back.”

“Yes,” replied Grandfather; “it was so called, because the British,
      without provocation, had fired upon a party of minute-men, near Lexington
      meeting-house, and killed eight of them. That fatal volley, which was
      fired by order of Major Pitcairn, began the war of the Revolution.”

About this time, if Grandfather had been correctly informed, our chair
      disappeared from the British Coffee House. The manner of its departure
      cannot be satisfactorily ascertained. Perhaps the keeper of the Coffee
      House turned it out of doors on account of its old-fashioned aspect.
      Perhaps he sold it as a curiosity. Perhaps it was taken, without leave, by
      some person who regarded it as public property because it had once figured
      under Liberty Tree. Or perhaps the old chair, being of a peaceable
      disposition, has made use of its four oaken legs and run away from the
      seat of war.

“Meanwhile,” continued Grandfather, “during the mysterious non-appearance
      of our chair, an army of twenty thousand men had started up and come to
      the siege of Boston. General Gage and his troops were cooped up within the
      narrow precincts of the peninsula. On the 17th of June, 1775, the famous
      battle of Bunker Hill was fought. Here General Warren fell. The British
      got the victory, indeed, but with the loss of more than a thousand
      officers and men.”

“No, Charley,” said Grandfather, “I am not like other historians. Battles
      shall not hold a prominent place in the history of our quiet and
      comfortable old chair. But to-morrow evening, Laurence, Clara, and
      yourself, and dear little Alice too, shall visit the Diorama of Bunker
      Hill. There you shall see the whole business, the burning of Charlestown
      and all, with your own eyes, and hear the cannon and musketry with your
      own ears.”

THE next evening but one, when the children had given Grandfather a full
      account of the Diorama of Bunker Hill, they entreated him not to keep them
      any longer in suspense about the fate of his chair. The reader will
      recollect that, at the last accounts, it had trotted away upon its poor
      old legs nobody knew whither. But, before gratifying their curiosity,
      Grandfather found it necessary to say something about public events.

The Continental Congress, which was assembled at Philadelphia, was
      composed of delegates from all the colonies. They had now appointed George
      Washington, of Virginia, to be commander-in-chief of all the American
      armies. He was, at that time, a member of Congress; but immediately left
      Philadelphia, and began his journey to Massachusetts. On the 3d of July,
      1775, he arrived at Cambridge, and took command of the troops which were
      besieging General Gage.

“O Grandfather,” exclaimed Laurence, “it makes my heart throb to think
      what is coming now. We are to see General Washington himself.”

The children crowded around Grandfather and looked earnestly into his
      face. Even little Alice opened her sweet blue eyes, with her lips apart,
      and almost held her breath to listen; so instinctive is the reverence of
      childhood for the father of his country.

Grandfather paused a moment; for he felt as if it might be irreverent to
      introduce the hallowed shade of Washington into a history where an ancient
      elbow-chair occupied the most prominent place. However, he determined to
      proceed with his narrative, and speak of the hero when it was needful, but
      with an unambitious simplicity.

So Grandfather told his auditors, that, on General Washington’s arrival at
      Cambridge, his first care was to reconnoitre the British troops with his
      spy-glass, and to examine the condition of his own army. He found that the
      American troops amounted to about fourteen thousand men. They were
      extended all round the peninsula of Boston, a space of twelve miles, from
      the high grounds of Roxbury on the right to Mystic River on the left. Some
      were living in tents of sailcloth, some in shanties rudely constructed of
      boards, some in huts of stone or turf with curious windows and doors of
      basket-work.

In order to be near the centre and oversee the whole of this
      wide-stretched army, the commander-in-chief made his headquarters at
      Cambridge, about half a mile from the colleges. A mansion-house, which
      perhaps had been the country seat of some Tory gentle man, was provided
      for his residence.

“When General Washington first entered this mansion,” said Grandfather,
      “he was ushered up the staircase and shown into a handsome apartment. He
      sat down in a large chair, which was the most conspicuous object in the
      room. The noble figure of Washington would have done honor to a throne. As
      he sat there, with his hand resting on the hilt of his sheathed sword,
      which was placed between his knees, his whole aspect well befitted the
      chosen man on whom his country leaned for the defence of her dearest
      rights. America seemed safe under his protection. His face was grander
      than any sculptor had ever wrought in marble; none could behold him
      without awe and reverence. Never before had the lion’s head at the summit
      of the chair looked down upon such a face and form as Washington’s.”

“Why, Grandfather!” cried Clara, clasping her hands in amazement, “was it
      really so? Did General Washington sit in our great chair?”

“I knew how it would be,” said Laurence; “I foresaw it the moment
      Grandfather began to speak.”

Grandfather smiled. But, turning from the personal and domestic life of
      the illustrious leader, he spoke of the methods which Washington adopted
      to win back the metropolis of New England from the British.

The army, when he took command of it, was without any discipline or order.
      The privates considered themselves as good as their officers; and seldom
      thought it necessary to obey their commands, unless they understood the
      why and wherefore. Moreover, they were enlisted for so short a period,
      that, as soon as they began to be respectable soldiers, it was time to
      discharge them. Then came new recruits, who had to be taught their duty
      before they could be of any service. Such was the army with which
      Washington had to contend against more than twenty veteran British
      regiments.

Some of the men had no muskets, and almost all were without bayonets.
      Heavy cannon, for battering the British fortifications, were much wanted.
      There was but a small quantity of powder and ball, few tools to build
      intrenchments with, and a great deficiency of provisions and clothes for
      the soldiers. Yet, in spite of these perplexing difficulties, the eyes of
      the whole people were fixed on General Washington, expecting him to
      undertake some great enterprise against the hostile army.

The first thing that he found necessary was to bring his own men into
      better order and discipline. It is wonderful how soon he transformed this
      rough mob of country people into the semblance of a regular army. One of
      Washington’s most invaluable characteristics was the faculty of bringing
      order out of confusion. All business with which he had any concern seemed
      to regulate itself as if by magic. The influence of his mind was like
      light gleaming through an unshaped world. It was this faculty, more than
      any other, that made him so fit to ride upon the storm of the Revolution
      when everything was unfixed and drifting about in a troubled sea.

“Washington had not been long at the head of the army,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “before his soldiers thought as highly of him as if he had
      led them to a hundred victories. They knew that he was the very man whom
      the country needed, and the only one who could bring them safely through
      the great contest against the might of England. They put entire confidence
      in his courage, wisdom, and integrity.”

“Doubtless they would have gone whithersoever his sword pointed the way,”
       answered Grandfather; “and Washington was anxious to make a decisive
      assault upon the enemy. But as the enterprise was very hazardous, he
      called a council of all the generals in the army. Accordingly they came
      from their different posts, and were ushered into the reception-room. The
      commander-in-chief arose from our great chair to greet them.”

“There was General Artemas Ward,” replied Grandfather, “a lawyer by
      profession. He had commanded the troops before Washington’s arrival
      Another was General Charles Lee, who had been a colonel in the English
      army, and was thought to possess vast military science. He came to the
      council, followed by two or three dogs which were always at his heels.
      There was General Putnam, too, who was known all over New England by the
      name of Old Put.”

“The same,” said Grandfather; “and he had done good service in the old
      French War. His occupation was that of a farmer; but he left his plough in
      the furrow at the news of Lexington battle. Then there was General Gates,
      who afterward gained great renown at Saratoga, and lost it again at
      Camden. General Greene, of Rhode Island, was likewise at the council.
      Washington soon discovered him to be one of the best officers in the
      army.”

When the generals were all assembled, Washington consulted them about a
      plan for storming the English batteries. But it was their unanimous
      opinion that so perilous an enterprise ought not to be attempted. The
      army, therefore, continued to besiege Boston, preventing the enemy from
      obtaining supplies of provisions, but without taking any immediate
      measures to get possession of the town. In ‘this manner the sum met,
      autumn, and winter passed away.

“Many a night, doubtless,” said Grandfather, “after Washington had been
      all day on horseback, galloping from one post of the army to another, he
      used to sit in our great chair, rapt in earnest thought. Had you seen him,
      you might have supposed that his whole mind was fixed on the blue china
      tiles which adorned the old-fashioned fireplace. But, in reality, he was
      meditating how to capture the British army, or drive it out of Boston.
      Once, when there was a hard frost, he formed a scheme to cross the Charles
      River on the ice. But the other generals could not be persuaded that there
      was any prospect of success.”

“They lay idle in the town,” replied Grandfather. “General Gage had been
      recalled to England, and was succeeded by Sir William Howe. The British
      army and the inhabitants of Boston were now in great distress. Being shut
      up in the town so long, they had consumed almost all their provisions and
      burned up all their fuel. The soldiers tore down the Old North Church, and
      used its rotten boards and timbers for firewood. To heighten their
      distress, the small-pox broke out. They probably lost far more men by
      cold, hunger, and sickness than had been slain at Lexington and Bunker
      Hill.”

“At length,” continued Grandfather, “in March, 1776, General Washington,
      who had now a good supply of powder, began a terrible cannonade and
      bombardment from Dorchester Heights. One of the cannon-balls which he
      fired into the town struck the tower of the Brattle Street Church, where
      it may still be seen. Sir William Howe made preparations to cross over in
      boats and drive the Americans from their batteries, but was prevented by a
      violent gale and storm. General Washington next erected a battery on
      Nook’s Hill, so near the enemy that it was impossible for them to remain
      in Boston any longer.”

“Hurrah! Hurrah!” cried Charley, clapping his hands triumphantly. “I wish
      I had been there to see how sheepish the Englishmen looked.”

And as Grandfather thought that Boston had never witnessed a more
      interesting period than this, when the royal power was in its death agony,
      he determined to take a peep into the town and imagine the feelings of
      those who were quitting it forever.

“ALAS for the poor tories!” said Grandfather. “Until the very last morning
      after Washington’s troops had shown themselves on Nook’s Hill, these
      unfortunate persons could not believe that the audacious rebels, as they
      called the Americans, would ever prevail against King George’s army. But
      when they saw the British soldiers preparing to embark on board of the
      ships of war, then they knew that they had lost their country. Could the
      patriots have known how bitter were their regrets, they would have
      forgiven them all their evil deeds, and sent a blessing after them as they
      sailed away from their native shore.”

In order to make the children sensible of the pitiable condition of these
      men, Grandfather singled out Peter Oliver, chief justice of Massachusetts
      under the crown, and imagined him walking through the streets of Boston on
      the morning before he left it forever.

Old Chief Justice Oliver threw on his red cloak, and placed his
      three-cornered hat on the top of his white wig. In this garb he intended
      to go forth and take a parting look at objects that had been familiar to
      him from his youth. Accordingly, he began his walk in the north part of
      the town, and soon came to Faneuil Hall. This edifice, the cradle of
      liberty, had been used by the British officers as a playhouse.

“Would that I could see its walls crumble to dust!” thought the chief
      justice; and, in the bitterness of his heart, he shook his fist at the
      famous hall. “There began the mischief which now threatens to rend asunder
      the British empire. The seditious harangues of demagogues in Faneuil Hall
      have made rebels of a loyal people and deprived me of my country.”

He then passed through a narrow avenue and found himself in King Street,
      almost on the very spot which, six years before, had been reddened by the
      blood of the Boston massacre. The chief justice stepped cautiously, and
      shuddered, as if he were afraid that, even now, the gore of his
      slaughtered countrymen might stain his feet.

Before him rose the Town House, on the front of which were still displayed
      the royal arms. Within that edifice he had dispensed justice to the people
      in the days when his name was never mentioned without honor. There, too,
      was the balcony whence the trumpet had been sounded and the proclamation
      read to an assembled multitude, whenever a new king of England ascended
      the throne.

“I remember—I remember,” said Chief Justice Oliver to himself, “when
      his present most sacred Majesty was proclaimed. Then how the people
      shouted! Each man would have poured out his life-blood to keep a hair of
      King George’s head from harm. But now there is scarcely a tongue in all
      New England that does not imprecate curses on his name. It is ruin and
      disgrace to love him. Can it be possible that a few fleeting years have
      wrought such a change?”

It did not occur to the chief justice that nothing but the most grievous
      tyranny could so soon have changed the people’s hearts. Hurrying from the
      spot, he entered Cornhill, as the lower part of Washington Street was then
      called. Opposite to the Town House was the waste foundation of the Old
      North Church. The sacrilegious hands of the British soldiers had torn it
      down, and kindled their barrack fires with the fragments.

Farther on he passed beneath the tower of the Old South. The threshold of
      this sacred edifice was worn by the iron tramp of horses’ feet; for the
      interior had been used as a riding-school and rendezvous for a regiment of
      dragoons. As the chief justice lingered an instant at the door a trumpet
      sounded within, and the regiment came clattering forth and galloped down
      the street. They were proceeding to the place of embarkation.

“Let them go!” thought the chief justice, with somewhat of an old Puritan
      feeling in his breast. “No good can come of men who desecrate the house of
      God.”

He went on a few steps farther, and paused before the Province House. No
      range of brick stores had then sprung up to hide the mansion of the royal
      governors from public view. It had a spacious courtyard, bordered with
      trees, and enclosed with a wrought-iron fence. On the cupola that
      surmounted the edifice was the gilded figure of an Indian chief, ready to
      let fly an arrow from his bow. Over the wide front door was a balcony, in
      which the chief justice had often stood when the governor and high
      officers of the province showed themselves to the people.

While Chief Justice Oliver gazed sadly at the Province House, before which
      a sentinel was pacing, the double leaves of the door were thrown open, and
      Sir William Howe made his appearance. Behind him came a throng of
      officers, whose steel scabbards clattered against the stones as they
      hastened down the court-yard. Sir William Howe was a dark-complexioned
      man, stern and haughty in his deportment. He stepped as proudly in that
      hour of defeat as if he were going to receive the submission of the rebel
      general.

“Forward! gentlemen,” said Sir William Howe to the officers who attended
      him; “we have no time to hear lamentations now.”

And, coldly bowing, he departed. Thus the chief justice had a foretaste of
      the mortifications which the exiled New-Englanders afterwards suffered
      from the haughty Britons. They were despised even by that country which
      they had served more faithfully than their own.

A still heavier trial awaited Chief Justice Oliver, as he passed onward
      from the Province House. He was recognized by the people in the street.
      They had long known him as the descendant of an ancient and honorable
      family. They had seen him sitting in his scarlet robes upon the
      judgment-seat. All his life long, either for the sake of his ancestors or
      on account of his own dignified station and unspotted character, he had
      been held in high respect. The old gentry of the province were looked upon
      almost as noblemen while Massachusetts was under royal government.

But now all hereditary reverence for birth and rank was gone. The
      inhabitants shouted in derision when they saw the venerable form of the
      old chief justice. They laid the wrongs of the country and their own
      sufferings during the siege—their hunger, cold, and sickness—partly
      to his charge and to that of his brother Andrew and his kinsman
      Hutchinson. It was by their advice that the king had acted in all the
      colonial troubles. But the day of recompense was come.

“See the old tory!” cried the people, with bitter laughter. “He is taking
      his last look at us. Let him show his white wig among us an hour hence,
      and we’ll give him a coat of tar and feathers!”

The chief justice, however, knew that he need fear no violence so long as
      the British troops were in possession of the town. But, alas! it was a
      bitter thought that he should leave no loving memory behind him. His
      forefathers, long after their spirits left the earth, had been honored in
      the affectionate remembrance of the people. But he, who would henceforth
      be dead to his native land, would have no epitaph save scornful and
      vindictive words. The old man wept.

“They curse me, they invoke all kinds of evil on my head!” thought he, in
      the midst of his tears. “But, if they could read my heart, they would know
      that I love New England well. Heaven bless her, and bring her again under
      the rule of our gracious king! A blessing, too, on these poor, misguided
      people!”

The chief justice flung out his hands with a gesture, as if he were
      bestowing a parting benediction on his countrymen. He had now reached the
      southern portion of the town, and was far within the range of cannon-shot
      from the American batteries. Close beside him was the bread stump of a
      tree, which appeared to have been recently cut down. Being weary and heavy
      at heart, he was about to sit down upon the stump.

Suddenly it flashed upon his recollection that this was the stump of
      Liberty Tree! The British soldiers had cut it down, vainly boasting that
      they could as easily overthrow the liberties of America. Under its shadowy
      branches, ten years before, the brother of Chief Justice Oliver had been
      compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of the people by taking the oath
      which they prescribed. This tree was connected with all the events that
      had severed America from England.

“Accursed tree!” cried the chief justice, gnashing his teeth; for anger
      overcame his sorrow. “Would that thou hadst been left standing till
      Hancock, Adams, and every other traitor, were hanged upon thy branches!
      Then fitly mightest thou have been hewn down and cast into the flames.”

He turned back, hurried to Long Wharf without looking behind him, embarked
      with the British troops for Halifax, and never saw his country more.
      Throughout the remainder of his days Chief Justice Oliver was agitated
      with those same conflicting emotions that had tortured him while taking
      his farewell walk through the streets of Boston. Deep love and fierce
      resentment burned in one flame within his breast, Anathemas struggled with
      benedictions. He felt as if one breath of his native air would renew his
      life, yet would have died rather than breathe the same air with rebels.
      And such likewise were the feelings of the other exiles, a thousand in
      number, who departed with the British army. Were they not the most
      unfortunate of men?

“The misfortunes of those exiled tories,” observed Laurence, “must have
      made them think of the poor exiles of Acadia.”

“They had a sad time of it, I suppose,” said Charley. “But I choose to
      rejoice with the patriots, rather than be sorrowful with the tories.
      Grandfather, what did General Washington do now?”

“As the rear of the British army embarked from the wharf,” replied
      Grandfather, “General Washington’s troops marched over the Neck, through
      the fortification gates, and entered Boston in triumph. And now, for the
      first time since the Pilgrims landed, Massachusetts was free from the
      dominion of England. May she never again be subjected to foreign rule,—never
      again feel the rod of oppression!”

“Dear Grandfather,” asked little Alice, “did General Washington bring our
      chair back to Boston?”

“I know not how long the chair remained at Cambridge,” said Grandfather.
      “Had it stayed there till this time, it could not have found a better or
      more appropriate shelter, The mansion which General Washington occupied is
      still standing, and his apartments have since been tenanted by several
      eminent men. Governor Everett, while a professor in the University,
      resided there. So at an after period did Mr. Sparks, whose invaluable
      labors have connected his name with the immortality of Washington. And at
      this very time a venerable friend and contemporary of your Grandfather,
      after long pilgrimages beyond the sea, has set up his staff of rest at
      Washington’s headquarters.”

“You mean Professor Longfellow, Grandfather,” said Laurence. “Oh, how I
      should love to see the author of those beautiful Voices of the Night!”

“We will visit him next summer,” answered Grandfather, “and take Clara and
      little Alice with us,—and Charley, too, if he will be quiet.”

WHEN Grandfather resumed his narrative the next evening, he told the
      children that he had some difficulty in tracing the movements of the chair
      during a short period after General Washington’s departure from Cambridge.

Within a few months, however, it made its appearance at a shop in Boston,
      before the door of which was seen a striped pole. In the interior was
      displayed a stuffed alligator, a rattlesnake’s skin, a bundle of Indian
      arrows, an old-fashioned matchlock gun, a walking-stick of Governor
      Winthrop’s, a wig of old Cotton Mather’s, and a colored print of the
      Boston massacre. In short, it was a barber’s shop, kept by a Mr. Pierce,
      who prided himself on having shaved General Washington, Old Put, and many
      other famous persons.

“This was not a very dignified situation for our venerable chair,”
       continued Grandfather; “but, you know, there is no better place for news
      than a barber’s shop. All the events of the Revolutionary War were heard
      of there sooner than anywhere else. People used to sit in the chair,
      reading the newspaper, or talking, and waiting to be shaved, while Mr.
      Pierce, with his scissors and razor, was at work upon the heads or chins
      of his other customers.”

“I am sorry the chair could not betake itself to some more suitable place
      of refuge,” said Laurence.

“It was old now, and must have longed for quiet. Besides, after it had
      held Washington in its arms, it ought not to have been compelled to
      receive all the world. It should have been put into the pulpit of the Old
      South Church, or some other consecrated place.”

“Perhaps so,” answered Grandfather. “But the chair, in the course of its
      varied existence, had grown so accustomed to general intercourse with
      society, that I doubt whether it would have contented itself in the pulpit
      of the Old South. There it would have stood solitary, or with no livelier
      companion than the silent organ, in the opposite gallery, six days out of
      seven. I incline to think that it had seldom been situated more to its
      mind than on the sanded floor of the snug little barber’s shop.”

Then Grandfather amused his children and himself with fancying all the
      different sorts of people who had occupied our chair while they awaited
      the leisure Of the barber.

There was the old clergyman, such as Dr. Chauncey, wearing a white wig,
      which the barber took from his head and placed upon a wig-block. Half an
      hour, perhaps, was spent in combing and powdering this reverend appendage
      to a clerical skull. There, too, were officers of the Continental army,
      who required their hair to be pomatumed and plastered, so as to give them
      a bold and martial aspect. There, once in a while, was seen the thin,
      care-worn, melancholy visage of an old tory, with a Wig that, in times
      long past, had perhaps figured at a Province House ball. And there, not
      unfrequently, sat the rough captain of a privateer, just returned from a
      successful cruise, in which he had captured half a dozen richly laden
      vessels belonging to King George’s subjects. And sometimes a rosy little
      school-boy climbed into our chair, and sat staring, with wide-open eyes,
      at the alligator, the rattlesnake, and the other curiosities of the
      barber’s shop. His mother had sent him, with sixpence in his hand, to get
      his glossy curls cropped off. The incidents of the Revolution plentifully
      supplied the barber’s customers with topics of conversation. They talked
      sorrowfully of the death of General Montgomery and the failure of our
      troops to take Quebec; for the New-Englanders were now as anxious to get
      Canada from the English as they had formerly been to conquer it from the
      French.

“But very soon,” said Grandfather, “came news from Philadelphia, the most
      important that America had ever heard of. On the 4th of July, 1776,
      Congress had signed the Declaration of Independence. The thirteen colonies
      were now free and independent States. Dark as our prospects were, the
      inhabitants welcomed these glorious tidings, and resolved to perish rather
      than again bear the yoke of England.”

“It was a great day,—a glorious deed!” said Laurence, coloring high
      with enthusiasm. “And, Grandfather, I love to think that the sages in
      Congress showed themselves as bold and true as the soldiers in the field;
      for it must have required more courage to sign the Declaration of
      Independence than to fight the enemy in battle.”

Grandfather acquiesced in Laurence’s view of the matter. He then touched
      briefly and hastily upon the prominent events of the Revolution. The
      thunderstorm of war had now rolled southward, and did not again burst upon
      Massachusetts, where its first fury had been felt. But she contributed her
      full share. So the success of the contest. Wherever a battle was fought,—whether
      at Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, or
      Germantown,—some of her brave sons were found slain upon the field.

In October, 1777, General Burgoyne surrendered his army, at Saratoga, to
      the American general, Gates. The captured troops were sent to
      Massachusetts. Not long afterwards Dr. Franklin and other American
      commissioners made a treaty at Paris, by which France bound herself to
      assist our countrymen. The gallant Lafayette was already fighting for our
      freedom by the side of Washington. In 1778 a French fleet, commanded by
      Count d’Estaing, spent a considerable time in Boston harbor. It marks the
      vicissitudes of human affairs, that the French, our ancient enemies,
      should come hither as comrades and brethren, and that kindred England
      should be our foe.

“While the war was raging in the Middle and Southern States,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “Massachusetts had leisure to settle a new constitution of
      government instead of the royal charter. This was done in 1780. In the
      same year John Hancock, who had been president of Congress, was chosen
      governor of the State. He was the first whom the people had elected since
      the days of old Simon Bradstreet.”

“But, Grandfather, who had been governor since the British were driven
      away?” inquired Laurence. “General Gage and Sir William Howe were the last
      whom you have told us of.”

“There had been no governor for the last four years,” replied Grandfather.
      “Massachusetts had been ruled by the Legislature, to whom the people paid
      obedience of their own accord. It is one of the most remarkable
      circumstances in our history, that, when the charter government was
      overthrown by the war, no anarchy nor the slightest confusion ensued, This
      was a great honor to the people. But now Hancock was proclaimed governor
      by sound of trumpet; and there was again a settled government.”

Grandfather again adverted to the progress of the war. In 1781 General
      Greene drove the British from the Southern States. In October of the same
      year General Washington compelled Lord Cornwallis to surrender his army,
      at Yorktown, in Virginia. This was the last great event of the
      Revolutionary contest. King George and his ministers perceived that all
      the might of England could not compel America to renew her allegiance to
      the crown. After a great deal of discussion, a treaty of peace was signed
      in September, 1783.

“Now, at last,” said Grandfather, “after weary years of war, the regiments
      of Massachusetts returned in peace to their families. Now the stately and
      dignified leaders, such as General Lincoln and General Knox, with their
      powdered hair and their uniforms of blue and buff, were seen moving about
      the streets.”

“And little boys ran after them, I suppose,” remarked Charley; “and the
      grown people bowed respectfully.”

“They deserved respect; for they were good men as well as brave,” answered
      Grandfather. “Now, too, the inferior officers and privates came home to
      seek some peaceful occupation. Their friends remembered them as slender
      and smooth-checked young men; but they returned with the erect and rigid
      mien of disciplined soldiers. Some hobbled on crutches and wooden legs;
      others had received wounds, which were still rankling in their breasts.
      Many, alas! had fallen in battle, and perhaps were left unburied on the
      bloody field.”

“One would have thought so,” said Grandfather. “Yet only two or three
      years elapsed before the folly of some misguided men caused another
      mustering of soldiers. This affair was called Shays’s war, because a
      Captain Shays was the chief leader of the insurgents.”

Grandfather comforted his dear little girl by assuring her that there was
      no great mischief done. Shays’s war happened in the latter part of 1786
      and the beginning of the following year. Its principal cause was the
      badness of times. The State of Massachusetts, in its public capacity, was
      very much in debt. So likewise were many of the people. An insurrection
      took place, the object of which seems to have been to interrupt the course
      of law and get rid of debts and taxes.

James Bowdoin, a good and able man, was now governor of Massachusetts. He
      sent General Lincoln, at the head of four thousand men, to put down the
      insurrection. This general, who had fought through several hard campaigns
      in the Revolution, managed matters like an old soldier, and totally
      defeated the rebels at the expense of very little blood.

“There is but one more public event to be recorded in the history of our
      chair,” proceeded Grandfather. “In the year 1794 Samuel Adams was elected
      governor of Massachusetts. I have told you what a distinguished patriot he
      was, and how much he resembled the stern old Puritans. Could the ancient
      freemen of Massachusetts who lived in the days of the first charter have
      arisen from their graves, they would probably have voted for Samuel Adams
      to be governor.”

“He did,” replied Grandfather. “He had long been in the habit of visiting
      the barber’s shop, where our venerable chair, philosophically forgetful of
      its former dignities, had now spent nearly eighteen not uncomfortable
      years. Such a remarkable piece of furniture, so evidently a relic of
      long-departed times, could not escape the notice of Samuel Adams. He made
      minute researches into its history, and ascertained what a succession of
      excellent and famous people had occupied it.”

“How did he find it out?” asked Charley; “for I suppose the chair could
      not tell its own history.”

“There used to be a vast collection of ancient letters and other documents
      in the tower of the Old South Church,” answered Grandfather. “Perhaps the
      history of our chair was contained among these. At all events, Samuel
      Adams appears to have been well acquainted with it. When he became
      governor, he felt that he could have no more honorable seat than that
      which had been the ancient chair of state. He therefore purchased it for a
      trifle, and filled it worthily for three years as governor of
      Massachusetts.” “And what next?” asked Charley.

“That is all,” said Grandfather, heaving a sigh; for he could not help
      being a little sad at the thought that his stories must close here.
      “Samuel Adams died in 1803, at the age of above threescore and ten. He was
      a great patriot, but a poor man. At his death he left scarcely property
      enough to pay the expenses of his funeral. This precious chair, among his
      other effects, was sold at auction; and your Grandfather, who was then in
      the strength of his years, became the purchaser.”

Laurence, with a mind full of thoughts that struggled for expression, but
      could find none, looked steadfastly at the chair.

“Oh, how I wish that the chair could speak!” cried he. “After its long
      intercourse with mankind,—after looking upon the world for ages,—what
      lessons of golden wisdom it might utter! It might teach a private person
      how to lead a good and happy life, or a statesman how to make his country
      prosperous.”

GRANDFATHER was struck by Laurence’s idea that the historic chair should
      utter a voice, and thus pour forth the collected wisdom of two centuries.
      The old gentleman had once possessed no inconsiderable share of fancy; and
      even now its fading sunshine occasionally glimmered among his more sombre
      reflections.

As the history of his chair had exhausted all his facts, Grandfather
      determined to have recourse to fable. So, after warning the children that
      they must not mistake this story for a true one, he related what we shall
      call Grandfather’s Dream.

Laurence and Clara, where were you last night? Where were you, Charley,
      and dear little Alice? You had all gone to rest, and left old Grandfather
      to meditate alone in his great chair. The lamp had grown so dim that its
      light hardly illuminated the alabaster shade. The wood-fire had crumbled
      into heavy embers, among which the little flames danced, and quivered, and
      sported about like fairies.

And here sat Grandfather all by himself. He knew that it was bedtime; yet
      he could not help longing to hear your merry voices, or to hold a
      comfortable chat with some old friend; because then his pillow would be
      visited by pleasant dreams. But, as neither children nor friends were at
      hand, Grandfather leaned back in the great chair and closed his eyes, for
      the sake of meditating more profoundly.

And, when Grandfather’s meditations had grown very profound indeed, he
      fancied that he heard a sound over his head, as if somebody were preparing
      to speak.

As Grandfather did not know that any person was in the room, he started up
      in great surprise, and peeped hither and thither, behind the chair, and
      into the recess by the fireside, and at the dark nook yonder near the
      bookcase. Nobody could be seen.

But, just as he was going to resume his seat, Grandfather happened to look
      at the great chair. The rays of firelight were flickering upon it in such
      a manner that it really seemed as if its oaken frame were all alive. What!
      did it not move its elbow? There, too! It certainly lifted one of its
      ponderous fore legs, as if it had a notion of drawing itself a little
      nearer to the fire. Meanwhile the lion’s head nodded at Grandfather with
      as polite and sociable a look as a lion’s visage, carved in oak, could
      possibly be expected to assume. Well, this is strange!

“Good evening, my old friend,” said the dry and husky voice, now a little
      clearer than before. “We have been intimately acquainted so long that I
      think it high time we have a chat together.”

Grandfather was looking straight at the lion’s head, and could not be
      mistaken in supposing that it moved its lips. So here the mystery was all
      explained.

“I was not aware,” said Grandfather, with a civil salutation to his oaken
      companion, “that you possessed the faculty of speech. Otherwise I should
      often have been glad to converse with such a solid, useful, and
      substantial if not brilliant member of society.”

“Oh!” replied the ancient chair, in a quiet and easy tone, for it had now
      cleared its throat of the dust of ages, “I am naturally a silent and
      incommunicative sort of character. Once or twice in the course of a
      century I unclose my lips. When the gentle Lady Arbella departed this life
      I uttered a groan. When the honest mint-master weighed his plump daughter
      against the pine-tree shillings I chuckled audibly at the joke. When old
      Simon Bradstreet took the place of the tyrant Andros I joined in the
      general huzza, and capered on my wooden legs for joy. To be sure, the
      by-standers were so fully occupied with their own feelings that my
      sympathy was quite unnoticed.”

“Not often,” answered the chair. “I once talked with Sir William Phips,
      and communicated my ideas about the witchcraft delusion. Cotton Mather had
      several conversations with me, and derived great benefit from my
      historical reminiscences. In the days of the Stamp Act I whispered in the
      ear of Hutchinson, bidding him to remember what stock his countrymen were
      descended of, and to think whether the spirit of their forefathers had
      utterly departed from them. The last man whom I favored with a colloquy
      was that stout old republican, Samuel Adams.”

“And how happens it,” inquired Grandfather, “that there is no record nor
      tradition of your conversational abilities? It is an uncommon thing to
      meet with a chair that can talk.”

“Why, to tell you the truth,” said the chair, giving itself a hitch nearer
      to the hearth, “I am not apt to choose the most suitable moments for
      unclosing my lips. Sometimes I have inconsiderately begun to speak, when
      my occupant, lolling back in my arms, was inclined to take an after-dinner
      nap. Or perhaps the impulse to talk may be felt at midnight, when the lamp
      burns dim and the fire crumbles into decay, and the studious or thoughtful
      man finds that his brain is in a mist. Oftenest I have unwisely uttered my
      wisdom in the ears of sick persons, when the inquietude of fever made them
      toss about upon my cushion. And so it happens, that though my words make a
      pretty strong impression at the moment, yet my auditors invariably
      remember them only as a dream. I should not wonder if you, my excellent
      friend, were to do the same to-morrow morning.”

“Nor I either,” thought Grandfather to himself. However, he thanked this
      respectable old chair for beginning the conversation, and begged to know
      whether it had anything particular to communicate.

“I have been listening attentively to your narrative of my adventures,”
       replied the chair; “and it must be owned that your correctness entitles
      you to be held up as a pattern to biographers. Nevertheless, there are a
      few omissions which I should be glad to see supplied. For instance, you
      make no mention of the good knight Sir Richard Saltonstall, nor of the
      famous Hugh Peters, nor of those old regicide judges, Whalley, Goffe, and
      Dixwell. Yet I have borne the weight of all those distinguished characters
      at one time or another.”

Grandfather promised amendment if ever he should have an opportunity to
      repeat his narrative. The good old chair, which still seemed to retain a
      due regard for outward appearance, then reminded him how long a time had
      passed since it had been provided with a new cushion. It likewise
      expressed the opinion that the oaken figures on its back would show to
      much better advantage by the aid of a little varnish.

“And I have had a complaint in this joint,” continued the chair,
      endeavoring to lift one of its legs, “ever since Charley trundled his
      wheelbarrow against me.”

“And now, venerable chair, I have a favor to solicit. During an existence
      of more than two centuries you have had a familiar intercourse with men
      who were esteemed the wisest of their day. Doubtless, with your capacious
      understanding, you have treasured up many an invaluable lesson of wisdom.
      You certainly have had time enough to guess the riddle of life. Tell us,
      poor mortals, then, how we may be happy.”

The lion’s head fixed its eyes thoughtfully upon the fire, and the whole
      chair assumed an aspect of deep meditation. Finally it beckoned to
      Grandfather with its elbow, and made a step sideways towards him, as if it
      had a very important secret to communicate.

“As long as I have stood in the midst of human affairs,” said the chair,
      with a very oracular enunciation, “I have constantly observed that
      Justice, Truth, and Love are the chief ingredients of every happy life.”

“Justice, Truth, and Love!” exclaimed Grandfather. “We need not exist two
      centuries to find out that these qualities are essential to our happiness.
      This is no secret. Every human being is born with the instinctive
      knowledge of it.”

“Ah!” cried the chair, drawing back in surprise. “From what I have
      observed of the dealings of man with man, and nation with nation, I never
      should have suspected that they knew this all-important secret. And, with
      this eternal lesson written in your soul, do you ask me to sift new wisdom
      for you out of my petty existence of two or three centuries?”

“Not a word more,” interrupted the chair; “here I close my lips for the
      next hundred years. At the end of that period, if I shall have discovered
      any new precepts of happiness better than what Heaven has already taught
      you, they shall assuredly be given to the world.”

In the energy of its utterance the oaken chair seemed to stamp its foot,
      and trod (we hope unintentionally) upon Grandfather’s toe. The old
      gentleman started, and found that he had been asleep in the great chair,
      and that his heavy walking-stick had fallen down across his foot.

“Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clapping her hand, “you must dream a
      new dream every night about our chair!”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley said the same. But the good old gentleman
      shook his head, and declared that here ended the history, real or
      fabulous, of GRANDFATHER’S CHAIR.

MY DEAR SIR, I came from my house at Milton, the 26 in the morning. After
      dinner it was whispered in town there would be a mob at night, and that
      Paxton, Hallowell, the custom-house, and admiralty officers’ houses would
      be attacked; but my friends assured me that the rabble were satisfied with
      the insult I had received and that I was become rather popular. In the
      evening, whilst I was at supper and my children round me, somebody ran in
      and said the mob were coming. I directed my children to fly to a secure
      place, and shut up my house as I had done before, intending not to quit
      it; but my eldest daughter repented her leaving me, hastened back, and
      protested she would not quit the house unless I did. I could n’t stand
      against this, and withdrew with her to a neighboring house, where I had
      been but a few minutes before the hellish crew fell upon my house with the
      rage of devils, and in a moment with axes split down the doors and
      entered. My son being in the great entry heard them cry: “Damn him, he is
      upstairs, we’ll have him.” Some ran immediately as high as the top of the
      house, others filled the rooms below and cellars, and others remained
      without the house to be employed there.

Messages soon came one after another to the house where I was, to inform
      me the mob were coming in pursuit of me, and I was obliged to retire
      through yards and gardens to a house more remote, where I remained until 4
      o’clock, by which time one of the best finished houses in the Province had
      nothing remaining but the bare walls and floors. Not contented with
      tearing off all the wainscot and hangings, and splitting the doors to
      pieces, they beat down the partition walls; and although that alone cost
      them near two hours, they cut down the cupola or lanthorn, and they began
      to take the slate and boards from the roof, and were prevented only by the
      approaching daylight from a total demolition of the building. The
      garden-house was laid flat, and all my trees, etc., broke down to the
      ground.

Such ruin was never seen in America. Besides my plate and family pictures,
      household furniture of every kind, my own, my children’s, and servants’ 
      apparel, they carried off about Â£900 sterling in money, and emptied the
      house of everything whatsoever, except a part of the kitchen furniture,
      not leaving a single book or paper in it, and have scattered or destroyed
      all the manuscripts and other papers I had been collecting for thirty
      years together, besides a great number of public papers in my custody. The
      evening being warm, I had undressed me and put on a thin camlet surtout
      over my waistcoat. The next morning, the weather being changed, I had not
      clothes enough in my possession to defend me from the cold, and was
      obliged to borrow from my friends. Many articles of clothing and a good
      part of my plate have since been picked up in different quarters of the
      town, lint the furniture in general was cut to pieces before it was thrown
      out of the house, and most of the beds cut open, and the feathers thrown
      out of the windows. The next evening, I intended with my children to
      Milton, but meeting two or three small parties of the ruffians, who I
      suppose had concealed themselves in the country, and my coachman hearing
      one of them say, “There he is!” my daughters were terrified and said they
      should never be safe, and I was forced to shelter them that night at the
      Castle.

The encouragers of the first mob never intended matters should go this
      length, and the people in general expressed the utter detestation of this
      unparalleled outrage, and I wish they could be convinced what infinite
      hazard there is of the most terrible consequences from such demons, when
      they are let loose in a government where there is not constant authority
      at hand sufficient to suppress them. I am told the government here will
      make me a compensation for my own and my family’s loss, which I think
      cannot be much less than Â£3,000 sterling. I am not sure that they will. If
      they should not, it will be too heavy for me, and I must humbly apply to
      his majesty in whose service I am a sufferer; but this, and a much greater
      sum would be an insufficient compensation for the constant distress and
      anxiety of mind I have felt for some time past, and must feel for months
      to come. You cannot conceive the wretched state we are in. Such is the
      resentment of the people against the Stamp-Duty, that there can be no
      dependence upon the General Court to take any steps to enforce, or rather
      advise, to the payment of it. On the other hand, such will be the effects
      of not submitting to it, that all trade must cease, all courts fall, and
      all authority be at an end. Must not the ministry be excessively
      embarrassed? On the one hand, it will be said, if concessions are made,
      the Parliament endanger the loss of their authority over the Colony: on
      the other hand, if external forces should be used, there seems to be
      danger of a total lasting alienation of affection. Is there no
      alternative? May the infinitely wise God direct you.' WHERE id = 'cc6b25c3-51f9-4ae7-87ed-800191fdcd0d';

-- Update content for 'The True Story of Ah Q'
UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'VERY soon after the decease of my beloved father-in-law I began to
receive letters pressing upon me the desirableness of issuing as soon as
possible a memoir of him and his work.

The well-known autobiography, entitled "Narrative of the Lord''s Dealings
with George Müller," had been, and was still being, so greatly used by
God in the edification of believers and the conversion of unbelievers
that I hesitated to countenance any attempt to supersede or even
supplement it. But as, with prayer, I reflected upon the subject,
several considerations impressed me:

1st. The last volume of the Narrative ends with the year 1885, so that
there is no record of the last thirteen years of Mr. Müller''s life
excepting what is contained in the yearly reports of "The Scriptural
Knowledge Institution."

2d. The last three volumes of the Narrative, being mainly a condensation
of the yearly reports during the period embraced in them, contain much
unavoidable repetition.

3d. A book of, say, four hundred and fifty pages, containing the
substance of the four volumes of the Narrative, and carrying on the
history to the date of the decease of the founder of the institution,
would meet the desire of a large class of readers.

4th. Several brief sketches of Mr. Müller''s career had issued from the
press within a few days after the funeral; and one (written by Mr. F.
Warne and published by W. F. Mack & Co., Bristol), a very accurate and
truly appreciative sketch, had had a large circulation; but I was
convinced by the letters that reached me that a more comprehensive
memoir was called for, and would be produced, so I was led especially to
pray for guidance that such a book might be entrusted to the author
fitted by God to undertake it.

While waiting for the answer to this definite petition, though greatly
urged by publishers to proceed, I steadily declined to take any step
until I had clearer light. Moreover, I was, personally, occupied during
May and June in preparing the Annual Report of "The Scriptural Knowledge
Institution," and could not give proper attention to the other matter.

Just then I learned from Dr. Arthur T. Pierson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., that
he had been led to undertake the production of a memoir of Mr. Müller
for American readers, and requesting my aid by furnishing him with some
materials needed for the work.

Having complied with this request I was favoured by Dr. Pierson with a
syllabus of the method and contents of his intended work.

The more I thought upon the subject the more satisfied I became that no
one could be found more fitted to undertake the work which had been
called for on this side of the Atlantic also than this my well-known and
beloved friend.

He had had exceptional opportunities twenty years ago in the United
States, and in later years when visiting Great Britain, for becoming
intimately acquainted with Mr. Müller, with the principles on which the
Orphanage and other branches of "The Scriptural Knowledge Institution"
were carried on, and with many details of their working. I knew that Dr.
Pierson most thoroughly sympathized with these principles as being
according to the mind of God revealed in His word; and that he could,
therefore, present not merely the history of the external facts and
results of Mr. Müller''s life and labours, but could and would, by God''s
help, unfold, with the ardour and force of conviction, the secret
springs of that life and of those labours.

I therefore intimated to my dear friend that, provided he would allow me
to read the manuscript and have thus the opportunity of making any
suggestions that I felt necessary, I would, as my beloved
father-in-law''s executor and representative, gladly endorse his work as
the authorized memoir for British as well as American readers.

To this Dr. Pierson readily assented; and now, after carefully going
through the whole, I confidently recommend the book to esteemed readers
on both sides of the Atlantic, with the earnest prayer that the result,
in relation to the subject of this memoir, may be identical with that
produced by the account of the Apostle Paul''s "manner of life" upon the
churches of Judea which were in Christ (Gal. i. 24), viz.,

"They glorified GOD" in him.

DR. OLIVER W. HOLMES wittily said that an autobiography is what every
biography ought to be. The four volumes of "The Narrative of the Lord''s
Dealings with George Müller," already issued from the press and written
by his own hand, with a fifth volume covering his missionary tours, and
prepared by his wife, supplemented by the Annual Reports since
published, constitute essentially an autobiography—Mr. Müller''s own
life-story, stamped with his own peculiar individuality, and singularly
and minutely complete. To those who wish the simple journal of his life
with the details of his history, these printed documents make any other
sketch of him from other hands so far unnecessary.

There are, however, two considerations which have mainly prompted the
preparation of this brief memoir: first, that the facts of this
remarkable life might be set forth not so much with reference to the
chronological order of their occurrence, as events, as for the sake of
the lessons in living which they furnish, illustrating and enforcing
grand spiritual principles and precepts: and secondly, because no man so
humble as he would ever write of himself what, after his departure,
another might properly write of him that others might glorify God in
him.

No one could have undertaken this work of writing Mr. Müller''s life-story
without being deeply impressed with the opportunity thus afforded for
impressing the most vital truths that concern holy living and holy
serving; nor could any one have completed such a work without feeling
overawed by the argument which this narrative furnishes for a present,
living, prayer-hearing God, and for a possible and practical daily walk
with Him and work with Him. It has been a great help in the preparation
of this book that the writer has had such frequent converse with Mr.
James Wright, who was so long Mr. Müller''s associate and knew him so
intimately.

So prominent was the word of God as a power in Mr. Müller''s life that, in
an appendix, we have given peculiar emphasis to the great leading texts
of Scripture which inspired and guided his faith and conduct, and, so
far as possible, in the order in which such texts became practically
influential in his life; and so many wise and invaluable counsels are to
be found scattered throughout his journal that some of the most striking
and helpful have been selected, which may also be found in the appendix.

This volume has, like the life it sketches, but one aim. It is simply
and solely meant to extend, emphasize, and perpetuate George Müller''s
witness to a prayer-hearing God; to present, as plainly, forcibly, and
briefly as is practicable, the outlines of a human history, and an
experience of the Lord''s leadings and dealings, which furnish a
sufficient answer to the question:

A HUMAN life, filled with the presence and power of God, is one of God''s
choicest gifts to His church and to the world.

Things which are unseen and eternal seem, to the carnal man, distant and
indistinct, while what is seen and temporal is vivid and real.
Practically, any object in nature that can be seen or felt is thus more
real and actual to most men than the Living God. Every man who walks
with God, and finds Him a present Help in every time of need; who puts
His promises to the practical proof and verifies them in actual
experience; every believer who with the key of faith unlocks God''s
mysteries, and with the key of prayer unlocks God''s treasuries, thus
furnishes to the race a demonstration and an illustration of the fact
that "He is, and is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."

George Müller was such an argument and example incarnated in human
flesh. Here was a man of like passions as we are and tempted in all
points like as we are, but who believed God and was established by
believing; who prayed earnestly that he might live a life and do a work
which should be a convincing proof that God hears prayer and that it is
safe to trust Him at all times; and who has furnished just such a
witness as he desired. Like Enoch, he truly walked with God, and had
abundant testimony borne to him that he pleased God. And when, on the
tenth day of March, 1898, it was told us of George Müller that "he was
not," we knew that "God had taken him": it seemed more like a
translation than like death.

To those who are familiar with his long life-story, and, most of all, to
those who intimately knew him and felt the power of personal contact
with him, he was one of God''s ripest saints and himself a living proof
that a life of faith is possible; that God may be known, communed with,
found, and may become a conscious companion in the daily life. George
Müller proved for himself and for all others who will receive his
witness that, to those who are willing to take God at His word and to
yield self to His will, He is "the same yesterday and to-day and
forever": that the days of divine intervention and deliverance are past
only to those with whom the days of faith and obedience are past—in a
word, that believing prayer works still the wonders which our fathers
told of in the days of old.

The life of this man may best be studied, perhaps, by dividing it into
certain marked periods, into which it naturally falls, when we look at
those leading events and experiences which are like punctuation-marks or
paragraph divisions,—as, for example:

Thus the first period would cover twenty years; the second, ten; the
third, forty; the fourth, seventeen; and the last, six. However thus
unequal in length, each forms a sort of epoch, marked by certain
conspicuous and characteristic features which serve to distinguish it
and make its lessons peculiarly important and memorable. For example,
the first period is that of the lost days of sin, in which the great
lesson taught is the bitterness and worthlessness of a disobedient life.
In the second period may be traced the remarkable steps of preparation
for the great work of his life. The third period embraces the actual
working out of the divine mission committed to him. Then for seventeen
or eighteen years we find him bearing in all parts of the earth his
world-wide witness to God; and the last six years were used of God in
mellowing and maturing his Christian character. During these years he
was left in peculiar loneliness, yet this only made him lean more on the
divine companionship, and it was noticeable with those who were brought
into most intimate contact with him that he was more than ever before
heavenly-minded, and the beauty of the Lord his God was upon him.

The first period may be passed rapidly by, for it covers only the wasted
years of a sinful and profligate youth and early manhood. It is of
interest mainly as illustrating the sovereignty of that Grace which
abounds even to the chief of sinners. Who can read the story of that
score of years and yet talk of piety as the product of evolution? In his
case, instead of evolution, there was rather a revolution, as marked
and complete as ever was found, perhaps, in the annals of salvation. If
Lord George Lyttelton could account for the conversion of Saul of Tarsus
only by supernatural power, what would he have thought of George
Müller''s transformation! Saul had in his favor a conscience, however
misguided, and a morality, however pharisaic. George Müller was a
flagrant sinner against common honesty and decency, and his whole early
career was a revolt, not against God only, but against his own moral
sense. If Saul was a hardened transgressor, how callous must have been
George Müller!

He was a native of Prussia, born at Kroppenstaedt, near Halberstadt,
September 27, 1805. Less than five years later his parents removed to
Heimersleben, some four miles off, where his father was made collector
of the excise, again removing about eleven years later to Schoenebeck,
near Magdeburg, where he had obtained another appointment.

George Müller had no proper parental training. His father''s favoritism
toward him was harmful both to himself and to his brother, as in the
family of Jacob, tending to jealousy and estrangement. Money was put too
freely into the hands of these boys, hoping that they might learn how to
use it and save it; but the result was, rather, careless and vicious
waste, for it became the source of many childish sins of indulgence.
Worse still, when called upon to render any account of their
stewardship, sins of lying and deception were used to cloak wasteful
spending. Young George systematically deceived his father, either by
false entries of what he had received, or by false statements of what he
had spent or had on hand. When his tricks were found out, the punishment
which followed led to no reformation, the only effect being more
ingenious devices of trickery and fraud. Like the Spartan lad, George
Müller reckoned it no fault to steal, but only to have his theft found
out.

His own brief account of his boyhood shows a very bad boy and he
attempts no disguise. Before he was ten years old he was a habitual
thief and an expert at cheating; even government funds, entrusted to his
father, were not safe from his hands. Suspicion led to the laying of a
snare into which he fell: a sum of money was carefully counted and put
where he would find it and have a chance to steal it. He took it and hid
it under his foot in his shoe, but, he being searched and the money
being found, it became clear to whom the various sums previously missing
might be traced.

His father wished him educated for a clergyman, and before he was eleven
he was sent to the cathedral classical school at Halberstadt to be
fitted for the university. That such a lad should be deliberately set
apart for such a sacred office and calling, by a father who knew his
moral obliquities and offences, seems incredible—but, where a state
church exists, the ministry of the Gospel is apt to be treated as a
human profession rather than as a divine vocation, and so the standards
of fitness often sink to the low secular level, and the main object in
view becomes the so-called "living," which is, alas, too frequently
independent of holy living.

From this time the lad''s studies were mixed up with novel-reading and
various vicious indulgences. Card-playing and even strong drink got hold
of him. The night when his mother lay dying, her boy of fourteen was
reeling through the streets, drunk; and even her death failed to arrest
his wicked course or to arouse his sleeping conscience. And—as must
always be the case when such solemn reminders make one no better—he
only grew worse.

When he came to the age for confirmation He had to attend the class for
preparatory religious teaching; but this being to him a mere form, and
met in a careless spirit, another false step was taken: sacred things
were treated as common, and so conscience became the more callous. On
the very eve of confirmation and of his first approach to the Lord''s
Table he was guilty of gross sins; and on the day previous, when he met
the clergyman for the customary "confession of sin," he planned and
practised another shameless fraud, withholding from him eleven-twelfths
of the confirmation fee entrusted to him by his father!

In such frames of mind and with such habits of life George Müller, in
the Easter season of 1820, was confirmed and became a communicant.
Confirmed, indeed! but in sin, not only immoral and unregenerate, but so
ignorant of the very rudiments of the Gospel of Christ that he could not
have stated to an inquiring soul the simple terms of the plan of
salvation. There was, it is true about such serious and sacred
transactions, a vague solemnity which left a transient impression and
led to shallow resolves to live a better life; but there was no real
sense of sin or of repentance toward God, nor was there any dependence
upon a higher strength: and, without these, efforts at self-amendment
never prove of value or work lasting results.

The story of this wicked boyhood presents but little variety, except
that of sin and crime. It is one long tale of evil-doing and of the
sorrow which it brings. Once, when his money was all recklessly wasted,
hunger drove him to steal a bit of coarse bread from a soldier who was a
fellow lodger; and looking back, long afterward, to that hour of
extremity, he exclaimed, "What a bitter thing is the service of Satan,
even in this world!"

On his father''s removal to Schoenebeck in 1821 he asked to be sent to
the cathedral school at Magdeburg, inwardly hoping thus to break away
from his sinful snares and vicious companions, and, amid new scenes,
find help in self-reform. He was not, therefore, without at least
occasional aspirations after moral improvement; but again he made the
common and fatal mistake of overlooking the Source of all true
betterment. "God was not in all his thoughts." He found that to leave
one place for another was not to leave his sin behind, for he took
himself along.

His father, with a strange fatuity, left him to superintend sundry
alterations in his house at Heimersleben, arranging for him meanwhile to
read classics with the resident clergyman, Rev. Dr. Nagel. Being thus
for a time his own master, temptation opened wide doors before him. He
was allowed to collect dues from his father''s debtors, and again he
resorted to fraud, spending large sums of this money and concealing the
fact that it had been paid.

In November, 1821, he went to Magdeburg and to Brunswick, to which
latter place he was drawn by his passion for a young Roman Catholic
girl, whom he had met there soon after confirmation. In this absence
from home he took one step after another in the path of wicked
indulgence. First of all, by lying to his tutor he got his consent to
his going; then came a week of sin at Magdeburg and a wasting of his
father''s means at a costly hotel in Brunswick. His money being gone, he
went to the house of an uncle until he was sent away; then, at another
expensive hotel, he ran up bills until, payment being demanded, he had
to leave his best clothes as a security, barely escaping arrest. Then,
at Wolfenbuttel, he tried the same bold scheme again, until, having
nothing for deposit, he ran off, but this time was caught and sent to
jail. This boy of sixteen was already a liar and thief, swindler and
drunkard, accomplished only in crime, a companion of convicted felons
and himself in a felon''s cell. This cell, a few days later, a thief
shared: and these two held converse as fellow thieves, relating their
adventures to one another, and young Müller, that he might not be
outdone, invented lying tales of villainy to make himself out the more
famous fellow of the two!

Ten or twelve days passed in this wretched fellowship, until
disagreement led to a sullen silence between them. And so passed away
twenty-four dark days, from December 18, 1821, until the 12th of January
ensuing, during all of which George Müller was shut up in prison and
during part of which he sought as a favour the company of a thief.

His father learned of his disgrace and sent money to meet his hotel dues
and other "costs" and pay for his return home. Yet such was his
persistent wickedness that, going from a convict''s cell to confront his
outraged but indulgent parent, he chose as his companion in travel an
avowedly wicked man.

He was severely chastised by his father and felt that he must make some
effort to reinstate himself in his favour. He therefore studied hard and
took pupils in arithmetic and German, French and Latin. This outward
reform so pleased his father that he shortly forgot as well as forgave
his evil-doing; but again it was only the outside of the cup and platter
that was made clean: the secret heart was still desperately wicked and
the whole life, as God saw it, was an abomination.

George Müller now began to forge what he afterward called "a whole chain
of lies." When his father would no longer consent to his staying at
home, he left, ostensibly for Halle, the university town, to be
examined, but really for Nordhausen to seek entrance into the gymnasium.
He avoided Halle because he dreaded its severe discipline, and foresaw
that restraint would be doubly irksome when constantly meeting young
fellows of his acquaintance who, as students in the university, would
have much more freedom than himself. On returning home he tried to
conceal this fraud from his father; but just before he was to leave
again for Nordhausen the truth became known, which made needful new
links in that chain of lies to account for his systematic disobedience
and deception. His father, though angry, permitted him to go to
Nordhausen, where he remained from October, 1822, till Easter, 1825.

During these two and a half years he studied classics, French, history,
etc., living with the director of the gymnasium. His conduct so improved
that he rose in favour and was pointed to as an example for the other
lads, and permitted to accompany the master in his walks, to converse
with him in Latin. At this time he was a hard student, rising at four
A.M. the year through, and applying himself to his books till ten at
night.

Nevertheless, by his own confession, behind all this formal propriety
there lay secret sin and utter alienation from God. His vices induced an
illness which for thirteen weeks kept him in his room. He was not
without a religious bent, which led to the reading of such books as
Klopstock''s works, but he neither cared for God''s word, nor had he any
compunction for trampling upon God''s law. In his library, now numbering
about three hundred books, no Bible was found. Cicero and Horace,
Moliere and Voltaire, he knew and valued, but of the Holy Scriptures he
was grossly ignorant, and as indifferent to them as he was ignorant of
them. Twice a year, according to prevailing custom, he went to the
Lord''s Supper, like others who had passed the age of confirmation, and
he could not at such seasons quite avoid religious impressions. When the
consecrated bread and wine touched his lips he would sometimes take an
oath to reform, and for a few days refrain from some open sins; but
there was no spiritual life to act as a force within, and his vows were
forgotten almost as soon as made. The old Satan was too strong for the
young Müller, and, when the mighty passions of his evil nature were
roused, his resolves and endeavours were as powerless to hold him as
were the new cords which bound Samson, to restrain him, when he awoke
from his slumber.

It is hard to believe that this young man of twenty could lie without a
blush and with the air of perfect candor. When dissipation dragged him
into the mire of debt, and his allowance would not help him out, he
resorted again to the most ingenious devices of falsehood. He pretended
that the money wasted in riotous living had been stolen by violence,
and, to carry out the deception he studied the part of an actor. Forcing
the locks of his trunk and guitar-case, he ran into the director''s room
half dressed and feigning fright, declaring that he was the victim of a
robbery, and excited such pity that friends made up a purse to cover his
supposed losses. Suspicion was, however, awakened that he had been
playing a false part, and he never regained the master''s confidence; and
though he had even then no sense of sin, shame at being detected in such
meanness and hypocrisy made him shrink from ever again facing the
director''s wife, who, in his long sickness, had nursed him like a
mother.

Such was the man who was not only admitted to honourable standing as a
university student, but accepted as a candidate for holy orders, with
permission to preach in the Lutheran establishment. This student of
divinity knew nothing of God or salvation, and was ignorant even of the
gospel plan of saving grace. He felt the need for a better life, but no
godly motives swayed him. Reformation was a matter purely of expediency:
to continue in profligacy would bring final exposure, and no parish
would have him as a pastor. To get a valuable "cure" and a good "living"
he must make attainments in divinity, pass a good examination, and have
at least a decent reputation. Worldly policy urged him to apply himself
on the one hand to his studies and on the other to self-reform.

Again he met defeat, for he had never yet found the one source and
secret of all strength. Scarce had he entered Halle before his resolves
proved frail as a spider''s web, unable to restrain him from vicious
indulgences. He refrained indeed from street brawls and duelling,
because they would curtail his liberty, but he knew as yet no moral
restraints. His money was soon spent, and he borrowed till he could find
no one to lend, and then pawned his watch and clothes.

He could not but be wretched, for it was plain to what a goal of poverty
and misery, dishonour and disgrace, such paths lead. Policy loudly urged
him to abandon his evil-doing, but piety had as yet no voice in his
life. He went so far, however, as to choose for a friend a young man and
former schoolmate, named Beta, whose quiet seriousness might, as he
hoped, steady his own course. But he was leaning on a broken reed, for
Beta was himself a backslider. Again he was taken ill. God made him to
"possess the iniquities of his youth." After some weeks he was better,
and once more his conduct took on the semblance of improvement.

The true mainspring of all well-regulated lives was still lacking, and
sin soon broke out in unholy indulgence. George Müller was an adept at
the ingenuity of vice. What he had left he pawned to get money, and with
Beta and two others went on a four days'' pleasure-drive, and then
planned a longer tour in the Alps. Barriers were in the way, for both
money and passports were lacking; but fertility of invention swept all
such barriers away. Forged letters, purporting to be from their parents,
brought passports for the party, and books, put in pawn, secured money.
Forty-three days were spent in travel, mostly afoot; and during this
tour George Müller, holding, like Judas, the common purse, proved, like
him, a thief, for he managed to make his companions pay one third of his
own expenses.

The party were back in Halle before the end of September, and George
Müller went home to spend the rest of his vacation. To account plausibly
to his father for the use of his allowance a new chain of lies was
readily devised. So soon and so sadly were all his good resolves again
broken.

When once more in Halle, he little knew that the time had come when he
was to become a new man in Christ Jesus. He was to find God, and that
discovery was to turn into a new channel the whole current of his life.
The sin and misery of these twenty years would not have been reluctantly
chronicled but to make the more clear that his conversion was a
supernatural work, inexplicable without God. There was certainly nothing
in himself to ''evolve'' such a result, nor was there anything in his
''environment.'' In that university town there were no natural forces that
could bring about a revolution in character and conduct such as he
experienced. Twelve hundred and sixty students were there gathered, and
nine hundred of them were divinity students, yet even of the latter
number, though all were permitted to preach, not one hundredth part, he
says, actually "feared the Lord." Formalism displaced pure and undefiled
religion, and with many of them immorality and infidelity were cloaked
behind a profession of piety. Surely such a man, with such surroundings,
could undergo no radical change of character and life without the
intervention of some mighty power from without and from above! What this
force was, and how it wrought upon him and in him, we are now to see.

THE lost days of sin, now forever past, the days of heaven upon earth
began to dawn, to grow brighter till the perfect day.

We enter the second period of this life we are reviewing. After a score
of years of evil-doing George Müller was converted to God, and the
radical nature of the change strikingly proves and displays the
sovereignty of Almighty Grace. He had been kept amid scenes of
outrageous and flagrant sin, and brought through many perils, as well as
two serious illnesses, because divine purposes of mercy were to be
fulfilled in him. No other explanation can adequately account for the
facts.

Let those who would explain such a conversion without taking God into
account remember that it was at a time when this young sinner was as
careless as ever; when he had not for years read the Bible or had a copy
of it in his possession; when he had seldom gone to a service of
worship, and had never yet even heard one gospel sermon; when he had
never been told by any believer what it is to believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ and to live by God''s help and according to His Word; when, in
fact, he had no conception of the first principles of the doctrine of
Christ, and knew not the real nature of a holy life, but thought all
others to be as himself, except in the degree of depravity and iniquity.
This young man had thus grown to manhood without having learned that
rudimental truth that sinners and saints differ not in degree but in
kind; that if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation; yet the hard
heart of such a man, at such a time and in such conditions, was so
wrought upon by the Holy Spirit that he suddenly found entrance into a
new sphere of life, with new adaptations to its new atmosphere.

The divine Hand in this history is doubly plain when, as we now look
back, we see that this was also the period of preparation for his
life-work—a preparation the more mysterious because he had as yet no
conception or forecast of that work. During the next ten years we shall
watch the divine Potter, to Whom George Müller was a chosen vessel for
service, moulding and fitting the vessel for His use. Every step is one
of preparation, but can be understood only in the light which that
future casts backward over the unique ministry to the church and the
world, to which this new convert was all unconsciously separated by God
and was to become so peculiarly consecrated.

One Saturday afternoon about the middle of November, 1825, Beta said to
Müller, as they were returning from a walk, that he was going that
evening to a meeting at a believer''s house, where he was wont to go on
Saturdays, and where a few friends met to sing, to pray, and to read the
word of God and a printed sermon. Such a programme held out nothing
fitted to draw a man of the world who sought his daily gratifications at
the card-table and in the wine-cup, the dance and the drama, and whose
companionships were found in dissipated young fellows; and yet George
Müller felt at once a wish to go to this meeting, though he could not
have told why. There was no doubt a conscious void within him never yet
filled, and some instinctive inner voice whispered that he might there
find food for his soul-hunger—a satisfying something after which he had
all his life been unconsciously and blindly groping. He expressed the
desire to go, which his friend hesitated to encourage lest such a gay
and reckless devotee of vicious pleasures might feel ill at ease in such
an assembly. However, he called for young Müller and took him to the
meeting.

During his wanderings as a backslider, Beta had both joined and aided
George Müller in his evil courses, but, on coming back from the Swiss
tour, his sense of sin had so revived as to constrain him to make a full
confession to his father; and, through a Christian friend, one Dr.
Richter, a former student at Halle, he had been made acquainted with the
Mr. Wagner at whose dwelling the meetings were held. The two young men
therefore went together, and the former backslider was used of God to
"convert a sinner from the error of his way and save a soul from death
and hide a multitude of sins."

That Saturday evening was the turning-point in George Müller''s history
and destiny. He found himself in strange company, amid novel
surroundings, and breathing a new atmosphere. His awkwardness made him
feel so uncertain of his welcome that he made some apology for being
there. But he never forgot brother Wagner''s gracious answer: "Come as
often as you please! house and heart are open to you." He little knew
then what he afterward learned from blessed experience, what joy fills
and thrills the hearts of praying saints when an evil-doer turns his
feet, however timidly, toward a place of prayer!

All present sat down and sang a hymn. Then a brother—who afterward went
to Africa under the London Missionary Society—fell on his knees and
prayed for God''s blessing on the meeting. That kneeling before God in
prayer made upon Müller an impression never lost. He was in his
twenty-first year, and yet he had never before seen any one on his
knees praying, and of course had never himself knelt before God,—the
Prussian habit being to stand in public prayer.

A chapter was read from the word of God, and—all meetings where the
Scriptures were expounded, unless by an ordained clergyman, being under
the ban as irregular—a printed sermon was read. When, after another
hymn, the master of the house prayed, George Müller was inwardly saying:
"I am much more learned than this illiterate man, but I could not pray
as well as he." Strange to say, a new joy was already springing up in
his soul for which he could have given as little explanation as for his
unaccountable desire to go to that meeting. But so it was; and on the
way home he could not forbear saying to Beta: "All we saw on our journey
to Switzerland, and all our former pleasures, are as nothing compared to
this evening."

Whether or not, on reaching his own room, he himself knelt to pray he
could not recall, but he never forgot that a new and strange peace and
rest somehow found him as he lay in bed that night. Was it God''s wings
that folded over him, after all his vain flight away from the true nest
where the divine Eagle flutters over His young?

How sovereign are God''s ways of working! In such a sinner as Müller,
theologians would have demanded a great ''law work'' as the necessary
doorway to a new life. Yet there was at this time as little deep
conviction of guilt and condemnation as there was deep knowledge of God
and of divine things, and perhaps it was because there was so little of
the latter that there was so little of the former.

Our rigid theories of conversion all fail in view of such facts. We have
heard of a little child who so simply trusted Christ for salvation that
she could give no account of any ''law work.'' And as one of the old
examiners, who thought there could be no genuine conversion without a
period of deep conviction, asked her, "But, my dear, how about the
Slough of Despond?" she dropped a courtesy and said, "Please, sir, I
didn''t come that way!"

George Müller''s eyes were but half opened, as though he saw men as trees
walking; but Christ had touched those eyes, He knew little of the great
Healer, but somehow he had touched the hem of His garment of grace, and
virtue came out of Him who wears that seamless robe, and who responds
even to the faintest contact of the soul that is groping after
salvation. And so we meet here another proof of the infinite variety of
God''s working which, like the fact of that working, is so wonderful.
That Saturday evening in November, 1825, was to this young student of
Halle the parting of the ways. He had tasted that the Lord is
gracious, though he himself could not account for the new relish for
divine things which made it seem too long to wait a week for another
meal; so that thrice before the Saturday following he sought the house
of brother Wagner, there, with the help of brethren, to search the
Scriptures.

We should lose one of the main lessons of this life-story by passing too
hastily over such an event as this conversion and the exact manner of
it, for here is to be found the first great step in God''s preparation of
the workman for his work.

Nothing is more wonderful in history than the unmistakable signs and
proofs of preadaptation. Our life-occurrences are not disjecta
membra—scattered, disconnected, and accidental fragments. In God''s
book all these events were written beforehand, when as yet there was
nothing in existence but the plan in God''s mind—to be fashioned in
continuance in actual history—as is perhaps suggested in Psalm cxxxix.
16 (margin).

We see stones and timbers brought to a building site—the stones from
different quarries and the timbers from various shops—and different
workmen have been busy upon them at times and places which forbade all
conscious contact or cooperation. The conditions oppose all preconcerted
action, and yet, without chipping or cutting, stone fits stone, and
timber fits timber—tenons and mortises, and proportions and dimensions,
all corresponding so that when the building is complete it is as
perfectly proportioned and as accurately fitted as though it had been
all prepared in one workshop and put together in advance as a test. In
such circumstances no sane man would doubt that one presiding
mind—one architect and master builder—had planned that structure,
however many were the quarries and workshops and labourers.

And so it is with this life-story we are writing. The materials to be
built into one structure of service were from a thousand sources and
moulded into form by many hands, but there was a mutual fitness and a
common adaptation to the end in view which prove that He whose mind and
plan span the ages had a supreme purpose to which all human agents were
unconsciously tributary. The awe of this vision of God''s workmanship
will grow upon us as we look beneath and behind the mere human
occurrences to see the divine Hand shaping and building together all
these seemingly disconnected events and experiences into one life-work.

For example, what have we found to be the initial step and stage in
George Müller''s spiritual history? In a little gathering of believers,
where for the first time he saw a child of God pray on his knees, he
found his first approach to a pardoning God. Let us observe: this man
was henceforth to be singularly and peculiarly identified with simple
scriptural assemblies of believers after the most primitive and
apostolic pattern—meetings for prayer and praise, reading and
expounding of the Word, such as doubtless were held at the house of Mary
the mother of John Mark—assemblies mainly and primarily for believers,
held wherever a place could be found, with no stress laid on consecrated
buildings and with absolutely no secular or aesthetic attractions. Such
assemblies were to be so linked with the whole life, work, and witness
of George Müller as to be inseparable from his name, and it was in such
an assembly that the night before he died he gave out his last hymn and
offered his last prayer.

Not only so, but prayer, on the knees, both in secret and in such
companionship of believers, was henceforth to be the one great central
secret of his holy living and holy serving. Upon this corner-stone of
prayer all his life-work was to be built. Of Sir Henry Lawrence the
native soldiers during the Lucknow mutiny were wont to say that, "when
he looked twice up to heaven, once down to earth, and then stroked his
beard, he knew what to do." And of George Müller it may well be said
that he was to be, for more than seventy years, the man who
conspicuously looked up to heaven to learn what he was to do. Prayer for
direct divine guidance in every crisis, great or small, was to be the
secret of his whole career. Is there any accident in the exact way in
which he was first led to God, and in the precise character of the
scenes which were thus stamped with such lasting interest and
importance?

The thought of a divine plan which is thus emphasized at this point we
are to see singularly illustrated as we mark how stone after stone and
timber after timber are brought to the building site, and all so
mutually fitted that no sound of any human tool is to be heard while the
life-work is in building.

Of course a man that had been so profligate and prodigal must at least
begin at conversion to live a changed life. Not that all at once the old
sins were abandoned, for such total transformation demands deeper
knowledge of the word and will of God than George Müller yet had. But
within him a new separating and sanctifying Power was at work. There was
a distaste for wicked joys and former companions; the frequenting of
taverns entirely ceased, and a lying tongue felt new and strange bands
about it. A watch was set at the door of the lips, and every word that
went forth was liable to a challenge, so that old habits of untamed
speech were arrested and corrected.

At this time he was translating into German for the press a French
novel, hoping to use the proceeds of his work for a visit to Paris, etc.
At first the plan for the pleasure-trip was abandoned, then the question
arose whether the work itself should not be. Whether his convictions
were not clear or his moral courage not sufficient, he went on with the
novel. It was finished, but never published. Providential hindrances
prevented or delayed the sale and publication of the manuscript until
clearer spiritual vision showed him that the whole matter was not of
faith and was therefore sin, so that he would neither sell nor print the
novel, but burned it—another significant step, for it was his first
courageous act of self-denial in surrender to the voice of the
Spirit—and another stone or timber was thus ready for the coming
building.

He now began in different directions a good fight against evil. Though
as yet weak and often vanquished before temptation, he did not
habitually ''continue in sin,'' nor offend against God without godly
sorrow. Open sins became less frequent and secret sins less ensnaring.
He read the word of God, prayed often, loved fellow disciples, sought
church assemblies from right motives, and boldly took his stand on the
side of his new Master, at the cost of reproach and ridicule from his
fellow students.

George Müller''s next marked step in his new path was the discovery of
the preciousness of the word of God.

At first he had a mere hint of the deep mines of wealth which he
afterward explored. But his whole life-history so circles about certain
great texts that whenever they come into this narrative they should
appear in capitals to mark their prominence. And, of them all, that
''little gospel'' in John iii. 16 is the first, for by it he found a full
salvation:

"GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON, THAT
WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING
LIFE."

From these words he got his first glimpse of the philosophy of the plan
of salvation—why and how the Lord Jesus Christ bore our sins in His own
body on the tree as our vicarious Substitute and suffering Surety, and
how His sufferings in Gethsemane and Golgotha made it forever needless
that the penitent believing sinner should bear his own iniquity and die
for it.

Truly to grasp this fact is the beginning of a true and saving
faith—what the Spirit calls "laying hold." He who believes and knows
that God so loved him first, finds himself loving God in return, and
faith works by love to purify the heart, transform the life, and
overcome the world.

It was so with George Müller. He found in the word of God one great
fact: the love of God in Christ. Upon that fact faith, not feeling,
laid hold; and then the feeling came naturally without being waited for
or sought after. The love of God in Christ constrained him to a
love—infinitely unworthy, indeed, of that to which it responded, yet
supplying a new impulse unknown before. What all his father''s
injunctions, chastisements, entreaties, with all the urgent dictates of
his own conscience, motives of expediency, and repeated resolves of
amendment, utterly failed to effect, the love of God both impelled and
enabled him to do—renounce a life of sinful self-indulgence. Thus early
he learned that double truth, which he afterwards passionately loved to
teach others, that in the blood of God''s atoning Lamb is the Fountain of
both forgiveness and cleansing. Whether we seek pardon for sin or power
over sin, the sole source and secret are in Christ''s work for us.

The new year 1826 was indeed a new year to this newborn soul. He now
began to read missionary journals, which kindled a new flame in his
heart. He felt a yearning—not very intelligent as yet—to be himself a
messenger to the nations, and frequent praying deepened and confirmed
the impression. As his knowledge of the world-field enlarged, new facts
as to the destitution and the desolation of heathen peoples became as
fuel to feed this flame of the mission spirit.

A carnal attachment, however, for a time almost quenched this fire of
God within. He was drawn to a young woman of like age, a professed
believer, whom he had met at the Saturday-evening meetings; but he had
reason to think that her parents would not give her up to a missionary
life, and he began, half-unconsciously, to weigh in the balance his
yearning for service over against his passion for a fellow creature.
Inclination, alas, outweighed duty. Prayer lost its power and for the
time was almost discontinued, with corresponding decline in joy. His
heart was turned from the foreign field, and in fact from all
self-denying service. Six weeks passed in this state of spiritual
declension, when God took a strange way to reclaim the backslider.

A young brother, Hermann Ball, wealthy, cultured, with every promising
prospect for this world to attract him, made a great self-sacrifice. He
chose Poland as a field, and work among the Jews as his mission,
refusing to stay at home to rest in the soft nest of self-indulgent and
luxurious ease. This choice made on young Müller a deep impression. He
was compelled to contrast with it his own course. For the sake of a
passionate love for a young woman he had given up the work to which he
felt drawn of God, and had become both joyless and prayerless: another
young man, with far more to draw him worldward, had, for the sake of a
self-denying service among despised Polish Jews, resigned all the
pleasures and treasures of the world. Hermann Ball was acting and
choosing as Moses did in the crisis of his history, while he, George
Müller, was acting and choosing more like that profane person Esau, when
for one morsel of meat he bartered his birthright. The result was a new
renunciation—he gave up the girl he loved, and forsook a connection
which had been formed without faith and prayer and had proved a source
of alienation from God.

Here we mark another new and significant step in preparation for his
life-work—a decided step forward, which became a pattern for his
after-life. For the second time a decision for God had cost him marked
self-denial. Before, he had burned his novel; now, on the same altar,
he gave up to the consuming fire a human passion which had over him an
unhallowed influence. According to the measure of his light thus far,
George Müller was fully, unreservedly given up to God, and therefore
walking in the light. He did not have to wait long for the recompense of
the reward, for the smile of God repaid him for the loss of a human
love, and the peace of God was his because the God of peace was with
him.

Every new spring of inward joy demands a channel for outflow, and so he
felt impelled to bear witness. He wrote to his father and brother of his
own happy experience, begging them to seek and find a like rest in God,
thinking that they had but to know the path that leads to such joy to be
equally eager to enter it. But an angry response was all the reply that
his letter evoked.

About the same time the famous Dr. Tholuck took the chair of professor
of divinity at Halle, and the advent of such a godly man to the faculty
drew pious students from other schools of learning, and so enlarged
George Müllers circle of fellow believers, who helped him much through
grace. Of course the missionary spirit revived, and with such increased
fervor, that he sought his father''s permission to connect himself with
some missionary institution in Germany. His father was not only much
displeased, but greatly disappointed, and dealt in reproaches very hard
to bear. He reminded George of all the money he had spent on his
education in the expectation that he would repay him by getting such a
''living'' as would insure to the parent a comfortable home and support
for his old age; and in a fit of rage he exclaimed that he would no
longer look on him as a son.

Then, seeing that son unmoved in his quiet steadfastness, he changed
tone, and from threats turned to tears of entreaty that were much harder
to resist than reproaches. The result of the interview was a third
significant step in preparation for his son''s life''s mission. His
resolve was unbroken to follow the Lord''s leading at any cost, but he
now clearly saw that he could be independent of man only by being more
entirely dependent on God, and that henceforth he should take no more
money from his father. To receive such support implied obedience to his
wishes, for it seemed plainly wrong to look to him for the cost of his
training when he had no prospect nor intention of meeting his known
expectations. If he was to live on his father''s money, he was under a
tacit obligation to carry out his plans and seek a good living as a
clergyman at home. Thus early in life George Müller learned the valuable
lesson that one must preserve his independence if he would not endanger
his integrity.

God was leading His servant in his youth to cast himself upon Him for
temporal supplies. This step was not taken without cost, for the two
years yet to be spent at the university would require more outlay than
during any time previous. But thus early also did he find God a faithful
Provider and Friend in need. Shortly after, certain American gentlemen,
three of whom were college professors,* being in Halle and wishing
instruction in German, were by Dr. Tholuck recommended to employ George
Müller as tutor; and the pay was so ample for the lessons taught them
and the lectures written out for them, that all wants were more than
met. Thus also in his early life was written large in the chambers of
his memory another golden text from the word of God:

"O FEAR THE LORD, YE HIS SAINTS!
    FOR THERE IS NO WANT TO THEM THAT FEAR HIM."
              (Psalm xxxiv. 9.)

* One of them, the Rev. Charles Hodge, afterward so well known as
professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, etc.

THE workman of God needs to wait on Him to know the work he is to do and
the sphere where he is to serve Him.

Mature disciples at Halle advised George Müller for the time thus
quietly to wait for divine guidance, and meanwhile to take no further
steps toward the mission field. He felt unable, however, to dismiss the
question, and was so impatient to settle it that he made the common
blunder of attempting to come to a decision in a carnal way. He
resorted to the lot, and not only so, but to the lot as cast in the lap
of the lottery! In other words, he first drew a lot in private, and
then bought a ticket in a royal lottery, expecting his steps to be
guided in a matter so solemn as the choice of a field for the service of
God, by the turn of the ''wheel of fortune''! Should his ticket draw a
prize he would go; if not, stay at home. Having drawn a small sum,
he accordingly accepted this as a ''sign,'' and at once applied to the
Berlin Missionary Society, but was not accepted because his application
was not accompanied with his father''s consent.

Thus a higher Hand had disposed while man proposed. God kept out of the
mission field, at this juncture, one so utterly unfit for His work that
he had not even learned that primary lesson that he who would work with
God must first wait on Him and wait for Him, and that all undue haste in
such a matter is worse than waste. He who kept Moses waiting forty years
before He sent him to lead out captive Israel, who withdrew Saul of
Tarsus three years into Arabia before he sent him as an apostle to the
nations, and who left even His own Son thirty years in obscurity before
His manifestation as Messiah—this God is in no hurry to put other
servants at work. He says to all impatient souls: "My time is not yet
full come, but your time is always ready."

Only twice after this did George Müller ever resort to the lot: once at
a literal parting of the ways when he was led by it to take the wrong
fork of the road, and afterward in a far more important matter, but with
a like result: in both cases he found he had been misled, and henceforth
abandoned all such chance methods of determining the mind of God. He
learned two lessons, which new dealings of God more and more deeply
impressed:

These lessons should not be lightly passed over, for they are too
valuable. The flesh is impatient of all delay, both in decision and
action; hence all carnal choices are immature and premature, and all
carnal courses are mistaken and unspiritual. God is often moved to delay
that we may be led to pray, and even the answers to prayer are deferred
that the natural and carnal spirit may be kept in check and self-will
may bow before the will of God.

In a calm review of his course many years later George Müller saw that
he "ran hastily to the lot" as a shorter way of settling a doubtful
matter, and that, especially in the question of God''s call to the
mission field, this was shockingly improper. He saw also how unfit he
had been at that time for the work he sought: he should rather have
asked himself how one so ignorant and so needing to be taught could
think of teaching others! Though a child of God, he could not as yet
have given a clear statement or explanation of the most elementary
gospel truths. The one thing needful was therefore to have sought
through much prayer and Bible study to get first of all a deeper
knowledge and a deeper experience of divine things. Impatience to settle
a matter so important was itself seen to be a positive disqualification
for true service, revealing unfitness to endure hardship as a good
soldier of Jesus Christ. There is a constant strain and drain on patient
waiting which is a necessary feature of missionary trial and
particularly the trial of deferred harvests. One who, at the outset,
could not brook delay in making his first decision, and wait for God to
make known His will in His own way and time, would not on the field have
had long patience as a husbandman, waiting for the precious fruit of his
toil, or have met with quietness of spirit the thousand perplexing
problems of work among the heathen!

Moreover the conviction grew that, could he have followed the lot, his
choice would have been a life-mistake. His mind, at that time, was bent
upon the East Indies as a field. Yet all subsequent events clearly
showed that God''s choice for him was totally different. His repeated
offers met as repeated refusals, and though on subsequent occasions he
acted most deliberately and solemnly, no open door was found, but he was
in every case kept from following out his honest purpose. Nor could the
lot be justified as an indication of his ultimate call to the mission
field, for the purpose of it was definite, namely, to ascertain, not
whether at some period of his life he was to go forth, but whether at
that time he was to go or stay. The whole after-life of George Müller
proved that God had for him an entirely different plan, which He was not
ready yet to reveal, and which His servant was not yet prepared to see
or follow. If any man''s life ever was a plan of God, surely this life
was; and the Lord''s distinct, emphatic leading, when made known, was not
in this direction. He had purposed for George Müller a larger field than
the Indies, and a wider witness than even the gospel message to heathen
peoples. He was ''not suffered'' to go into ''Bithynia'' because ''Macedonia''
was waiting for his ministry.

With increasing frequency, earnestness, and minuteness, was George
Müller led to put before God, in prayer, all matters that lay upon his
mind. This man was to be peculiarly an example to believers as an
intercessor; and so God gave him from the outset a very simple,
childlike disposition toward Himself. In many things he was in
knowledge and in strength to outgrow childhood and become a man, for it
marks immaturity when we err through ignorance and are overcome through
weakness. But in faith and in the filial spirit, he always continued to
be a little child. Mr. J. Hudson Taylor well reminds us that while in
nature the normal order of growth is from childhood to manhood and so to
maturity, in grace the true development is perpetually backward toward
the cradle: we must become and continue as little children, not losing,
but rather gaining, childlikeness of spirit. The disciple''s maturest
manhood is only the perfection of his childhood. George Müller was never
so really, truly, fully a little child in all his relations to his
Father, as when in the ninety-third year of his age.

Being thus providentially kept from the Indies, he began definite work
at home, though yet having little real knowledge of the divine art of
coworking with God. He spoke to others of their soul''s welfare, and
wrote to former companions in sin, and circulated tracts and missionary
papers. Nor were his labours without encouragement, though sometimes his
methods were awkward or even grotesque, as when, speaking to a beggar in
the fields about his need of salvation, he tried to overcome apathetic
indifference by speaking louder and louder, as though, mere bawling in
his ears would subdue the hardness of his heart!

In 1826 he first attempted to preach. An unconverted schoolmaster some
six miles from Halle he was the means of turning to the Lord; and this
schoolmaster asked him to come and help an aged, infirm clergyman in the
parish. Being a student of divinity he was at liberty to preach, but
conscious ignorance had hitherto restrained him. He thought, however,
that by committing some other man''s sermon to memory he might profit the
hearers, and so he undertook it. It was slavish work to prepare, for it
took most of a week to memorize the sermon, and it was joyless work to
deliver it, for there was none of the living power that attends a man''s
God-given message and witness. His conscience was not yet enlightened
enough to see that he was acting a false part in preaching another''s
sermon as his own; nor had he the spiritual insight to perceive that it
is not God''s way to set up a man to preach who knows not enough of
either His word or the life of the Spirit within him, to prepare his own
discourse. How few even among preachers feel preaching to be a divine
vocation and not a mere human profession; that a ministry of the truth
implies the witness of experience, and that to preach another man''s
sermon is, at the best, unnatural walking on stilts!

George Müller ''got through'' his painful effort of August 27, 1826,
reciting this memoriter sermon at eight A.M. in the chapel of ease, and
three hours later in the parish church. Being asked to preach again in
the afternoon, but having no second sermon committed to memory, he had
to keep silent, or depend on the Lord for help. He thought he could at
least read the fifth chapter of Matthew, and simply expound it. But he
had no sooner begun the first beatitude than he felt himself greatly
assisted. Not only were his lips opened, but the Scriptures were opened
too, his own soul expanded, and a peace and power, wholly unknown to his
tame, mechanical repetitions of the morning, accompanied the simpler
expositions of the afternoon, with this added advantage, that he talked
on a level with the people and not over their heads, his colloquial,
earnest speech riveting their attention.

Going back to Halle, he said to himself, ''This is the true way to
preach,'' albeit he felt misgivings lest such a simple style of
exposition might not suit so well a cultured refined city congregation.
He had yet to learn how the enticing words of man''s wisdom make the
cross of Christ of none effect, and how the very simplicity that makes
preaching intelligible to the illiterate makes sure that the most
cultivated will also understand it, whereas the reverse is not true.

Here was another very important step in his preparation for subsequent
service. He was to rank throughout life among the simplest and most
scriptural of preachers. This first trial of pulpit-work led to frequent
sermons, and in proportion as his speech was in the simplicity that is
in Christ did he find joy in his work and a harvest from it. The
committed sermon of some great preacher might draw forth human praise,
but it was the simple witness of the Word, and of the believer to the
Word, that had praise of God. His preaching was not then much owned of
God in fruit. Doubtless the Lord saw that he was not ready for reaping,
and scarcely for sowing: there was yet too little prayer in preparation
and too little unction in delivery, and so his labours were
comparatively barren of results.

About this same time he took another step—perhaps the most significant
thus far in its bearing on the precise form of work so closely linked
with his name. For some two months he availed himself of the free
lodgings furnished for poor divinity students in the famous Orphan
Houses built by A. H. Francke. This saintly man, a professor of
divinity at Halle, who had died a hundred years before (1727), had been
led to found an orphanage in entire dependence upon God. Half
unconsciously George Müller''s whole life-work at Bristol found both its
suggestion and pattern in Francke''s orphanage at Halle. The very
building where this young student lodged was to him an object lesson—a
visible, veritable, tangible proof that the Living God hears prayer, and
can, in answer to prayer alone, build a house for orphan children. That
lesson was never lost, and George Müller fell into the apostolic
succession of such holy labour! He often records how much his own
faith-work was indebted to that example of simple trust in prayer
exhibited by Francke. Seven years later he read his life, and was
thereby still more prompted to follow him as he followed Christ.

George Müller''s spiritual life in these early days was strangely
chequered. For instance, he who, as a Lutheran divinity student, was
essaying to preach, hung up in his room a framed crucifix, hoping
thereby to keep in mind the sufferings of Christ and so less frequently
fall into sin. Such helps, however, availed him little, for while he
rested upon such artificial props, it seemed as though he sinned the
oftener.

He was at this time overworking, writing sometimes fourteen hours a day,
and this induced nervous depression, which exposed him to various
temptations. He ventured into a confectioner''s shop where wine and beer
were sold, and then suffered reproaches of conscience for conduct so
unbecoming a believer; and he found himself indulging ungracious and
ungrateful thoughts of God, who, instead of visiting him with deserved
chastisement, multiplied His tender mercies.

He wrote to a rich, liberal and titled lady, asking a loan, and received
the exact sum asked for, with a letter, not from her, but from another
into whose hands his letter had fallen by "a peculiar providence," and
who signed it as "An adoring worshipper of the Saviour Jesus Christ."
While led to send the money asked for, the writer added wise words of
caution and counsel—words so fitted to George Müller''s exact need that
he saw plainly the higher Hand that had guided the anonymous writer. In
that letter he was urged to "seek by watching and prayer to be delivered
from all vanity and self-complacency," to make it his "chief aim to be
more and more humble, faithful, and quiet," and not to be of those who
"say ''Lord, Lord,'' but have Him not deeply in their hearts." He was also
reminded that "Christianity consists not in words but in power, and that
there must be life in us."

He was deeply moved by this message from God through an unknown party,
and the more as it had come, with its enclosure, at the time when he was
not only guilty of conduct unbecoming a disciple, but indulging hard
thoughts of his heavenly Father. He went out to walk alone, and was so
deeply wrought on by God''s goodness and his own ingratitude that he
knelt behind a hedge, and, though in snow a foot deep, he forgot himself
for a half-hour in praise, prayer, and self-surrender.

Yet so deceitful is the human heart that a few weeks later he was in
such a backslidden state that, for a time, he was again both careless
and prayerless, and one day sought to drown the voice of conscience in
the wine-cup. The merciful Father gave not up his child to folly and
sin. He who once could have gone to great lengths in dissipation now
found a few glasses of wine more than enough; his relish for such
pleasures was gone, and so was the power to silence the still small
voice of conscience and of the Spirit of God.

Such vacillations in Christian experience were due in part to the lack
of holy associations and devout companionships. Every disciple needs
help in holy living, and this young believer yearned for that spiritual
uplift afforded by sympathetic fellow believers. In vacation times he
had found at Gnadau, the Moravian settlement some three miles from his
father''s residence, such soul refreshment, but Halle itself supplied
little help. He went often to church, but seldom heard the Gospel, and
in that town of over 30,000, with all its ministers, he found not one
enlightened clergyman. When, therefore, he could hear such a preacher as
Dr. Tholuck, he would walk ten or fifteen miles to enjoy such a
privilege. The meetings continued at Mr. Wagner''s house; and on the
Lord''s day evenings some six or more believing students were wont to
gather, and both these assemblies were means of grace. From Easter,
1827, so long as he remained in Halle, this latter meeting was held in
his own room, and must rank alongside those little gatherings of the
"Holy Club" in Lincoln College, Oxford, which a hundred years before had
shaped the Wesleys and Whitefield for their great careers. Before George
Müller left Halle the attendance at this weekly meeting in his room had
grown to twenty.

These assemblies were throughout very simple and primitive. In addition
to prayer, singing, and reading of God''s word, one or more brethren
exhorted or read extracts from devout books. Here young Müller freely
opened his heart to others, and through their counsels and prayers was
delivered from many snares.

One lesson, yet to be learned, was that the one fountain of all wisdom
and strength is the Holy Scriptures. Many disciples practically prefer
religious books to the Book of God. He had indeed found much of the
reading with which too many professed believers occupy their minds to be
but worthless chaff—such as French and German novels; but as yet he had
not formed the habit of reading the word of God daily and systematically
as in later life, almost to the exclusion of other books. In his
ninety-second year, he said to the writer, that for every page of any
other reading he was sure he read ten of the Bible. But, up to that
November day in 1825 when he first met a praying band of disciples, he
had never to his recollection read one chapter in the Book of books; and
for the first four years of his new life he gave to the works of
uninspired men practical preference over the Living Oracles.

After a true relish for the Scriptures had been created, he could not
understand how he could ever have treated God''s Book with such neglect.
It seemed obvious that God''s having condescended to become an Author,
inspiring holy men to write the Scriptures, He would in them impart the
most vital truths; His message would cover all matters which concern
man''s welfare, and therefore, under the double impulse of duty and
delight, we should instinctively and habitually turn to the Bible.
Moreover, as he read and studied this Book of God, he felt himself
admitted to more and more intimate acquaintance with the Author.
During the last twenty years of his life he read it carefully through,
four or five times annually, with a growing sense of his own rapid
increase in the knowledge of God thereby.

Such motives for Bible study it is strange that any true believer should
overlook. Ruskin, in writing "Of the King''s Treasuries," refers to the
universal ambition for ''advancement in life,'' which means ''getting into
good society.'' How many obstacles one finds in securing an introduction
to the great and good of this world, and even then in getting access to
them, in securing an audience with the kings and queens of human
society! Yet there is open to us a society of people of the very first
rank who will meet us and converse with us so long as we like, whatever
our ignorance, poverty, or low estate—namely, the society of authors;
and the key that unlocks their private audience-chamber is their books.

So writes Ruskin, and all this is beautifully true; but how few, even
among believers, appreciate the privilege of access to the great Author
of the universe through His word! Poor and rich, high and low, ignorant
and learned, young and old, all alike are welcomed to the
audience-chamber of the King of kings. The most intimate knowledge of
God is possible on one condition—that we search His Holy Scriptures,
prayerfully and habitually, and translate what we there find, into
obedience. Of him who thus meditates on God''s law day and night, who
looks and continues looking into this perfect law of liberty, the
promise is unique, and found in both Testaments: "Whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper"; "that man shall be blessed in his deed." (Comp. Psalm i.
3; Joshua i. 8; James i. 25.)

So soon as George Müller found this well-spring of delight and success,
he drank habitually at this fountain of living waters. In later life he
lamented that, owing to his early neglect of this source of divine
wisdom and strength, he remained so long in spiritual infancy, with its
ignorance and impotence. So long and so far as his growth in knowledge
of God was thus arrested his growth in grace was likewise hindered. His
close walk with God began at the point where he learned that such walk
is always in the light of that inspired word which is divinely declared
to be to the obedient soul "a lamp unto the feet and a light unto the
path." He who would keep up intimate converse with the Lord must
habitually find in the Scriptures the highway of such companionship.
God''s aristocracy, His nobility, the princes of His realm, are not the
wise, mighty, and high-born of earth, but often the poor, weak, despised
of men, who abide in His presence and devoutly commune with Him through
His inspired word.

Blessed are they who have thus learned to use the key which gives free
access, not only to the King''s Treasuries, but to the King Himself!

PASSION for souls is a divine fire, and in the heart of George Müller
that fire now began to burn more brightly, and demanded vent.

In August, 1827, his mind was more definitely than before turned toward
mission work. Hearing that the Continental Society of Britain sought a
minister for Bucharest, he offered himself through Dr. Tholuck, who, in
behalf of the Society, was on the lookout for a suitable candidate. To
his great surprise his father gave consent, though Bucharest was more
than a thousand miles distant and as truly missionary ground as any
other field. After a short visit home he came back to Halle, his face
steadfastly set toward his far-off field, and his heart seeking
prayerful preparation for expected self-sacrifice and hardship. But God
had other plans for His servant, and he never went to Bucharest.

In October following, Hermann Ball, passing through Halle, and being at
the little weekly meeting in Müller''s room, told him how failing health
forbade his continuing his work among Polish Jews; and at once there
sprang up in George Müller''s mind a strong desire to take his place.
Such work doubly attracted him, because it would bring him into close
contact with God''s chosen but erring people, Israel; and because it
would afford opportunity to utilize those Hebrew studies which so
engrossed him.

At this very time, calling upon Dr. Tholuck, he was asked, to his
surprise, whether he had ever felt a desire to labour among the
Jews—Dr. Tholuck then acting as agent for the London Missionary
Society for promoting missions among them. This question naturally
fanned the flame of his already kindled desire; but, shortly after,
Bucharest being the seat of the war then raging between the Russians and
Turks, the project of sending a minister there was for the time
abandoned. But a door seemed to open before him just as another shut
behind him.

The committee in London, learning that he was available as a missionary
to the Jews, proposed his coming to that city for six months as a
missionary student to prepare for the work. To enter thus on a sort of
probation was trying to the flesh, but, as it seemed right that there
should be opportunity for mutual acquaintance between committee and
candidate, to insure harmonious cooperation, his mind was disposed to
accede to the proposal.

There was, however, a formidable obstacle. Prussian male subjects must
commonly serve three years in the army, and classical students who have
passed the university examinations, at least one year. George Müller,
who had not served out even this shorter term, could not, without royal
exemption, even get a passport out of the country. Application was made
for such exemption, but it failed. Meanwhile he was taken ill, and after
ten weeks suffered a relapse. While at Leipzig with an American
professor with whom he went to the opera, he unwisely partook of some
refreshments between the acts, which again brought on illness. He had
broken a blood-vessel in the stomach, and he returned to Halle, never
again to enter a theatre. Subsequently being asked to go to Berlin for a
few weeks to teach German, he went, hoping at the Prussian capital to
find access to the court through persons of rank and secure the desired
exemption. But here again he failed. There now seemed no way of escaping
a soldier''s term, and he submitted himself for examination, but was
pronounced physically unfit for military duty. In God''s providence he
fell into kind hands, and, being a second time examined and found unfit,
he was thenceforth completely exempted for life from all service in the
army.

God''s lines of purpose mysteriously converged. The time had come; the
Master spake and it was done: all things moved in one direction—to set
His servant free from the service of his country, that, under the
Captain of his salvation, he might endure hardness as a good soldier of
Christ, without entanglement in the affairs of this life. Aside from
this, his stay at the capital had not been unprofitable, for he had
preached five times a week in the poorhouse and conversed on the Lord''s
days with the convicts in the prison.

In February, 1829, he left for London, on the way visiting his father at
Heimersleben, where he had returned after retirement from office; and he
reached the English metropolis March 19th. His liberty was much
curtailed as a student in this new seminary, but, as no rule conflicted
with his conscience, he submitted. He studied about twelve hours daily,
giving attention mainly to Hebrew and cognate branches closely connected
with his expected field. Sensible of the risk of that deadness of soul
which often results from undue absorption in mental studies, he
committed to memory much of the Hebrew Old Testament and pursued his
tasks in a prayerful spirit, seeking God''s help in matters, however
minute, connected with daily duty.

Tempted to the continual use of his native tongue by living with his
German countrymen, he made little progress in English, which he
afterward regretted; and he was wont, therefore, to counsel those who
propose to work among a foreign people, not only to live among them in
order to learn their language, but to keep aloof as far as may be from
their own countrymen, so as to be compelled to use the tongue which is
to give them access to those among whom they labour.

In connection with this removal to Britain a seemingly trivial
occurrence left upon him a lasting impress—another proof that there are
no little things in life. Upon a very small hinge a huge door may swing
and turn. It is, in fact, often the apparently trifling events that
mould our history, work, and destiny.

A student incidentally mentioned a dentist in Exeter—a Mr. Groves—who
for the Lord''s sake had resigned his calling with fifteen hundred pounds
a year, and with wife and children offered himself as a missionary to
Persia, simply trusting the Lord for all temporal supplies. This act
of self-denying trust had a strange charm for Mr. Müller, and he could
not dismiss it from his mind; indeed, he distinctly entered it in his
journal and wrote about it to friends at home. It was another lesson in
faith, and in the very line of that trust of which for more than sixty
years he was to be so conspicuous an example and illustration.

In the middle of May, 1829, he was taken ill and felt himself to be past
recovery. Sickness is often attended with strange self-disclosure. His
conviction of sin and guilt at his conversion was too superficial and
shallow to leave any after-remembrance. But, as is often true in the
history of God''s saints, the sense of guilt, which at first seemed to
have no roots in conscience and scarce an existence, struck deeper into
his being and grew stronger as he knew more of God and grew more like
Him. This common experience of saved souls is susceptible of easy
explanation. Our conceptions of things depend mainly upon two
conditions: first, the clearness of our vision of truth and duty; and
secondly, the standard of measurement and comparison. The more we live
in God and unto God, the more do our eyes become enlightened to see the
enormity and deformity of sin, so that we recognize the hatefulness of
evil more distinctly: and the more clearly do we recognize the
perfection of God''s holiness and make it the pattern and model of our
own holy living.

The amateur musician or artist has a false complacency in his own very
imperfect work only so far as his ear or eye or taste is not yet trained
to accurate discrimination; but, as he becomes more accomplished in a
fine art, and more appreciative of it, he recognizes every defect or
blemish of his previous work, until the musical performance seems a
wretched failure and the painting a mere daub. The change, however, is
wholly in the workman and not in the work: both the music and the
painting are in themselves just what they were, but the man is capable
of something so much better, that his standard of comparison is raised
to a higher level, and his capacity for a true judgment is
correspondingly enlarged.

Even so a child of God who, like Elijah, stands before Him as a waiting,
willing, obedient servant, and has both likeness to God and power with
God, may get under the juniper-tree of despondency, cast down with the
sense of unworthiness and ill desert. As godliness increases the sense
of ungodliness becomes more acute, and so feelings never accurately
gauge real assimilation to God. We shall seem worst in our own eyes when
in His we are best, and conversely.

A Mohammedan servant ventured publicly to challenge a preacher who, in
an Indian bazaar, was asserting the universal depravity of the race, by
affirming that he knew at least one woman who was immaculate, absolutely
without fault, and that woman, his own Christian mistress. The preacher
bethought himself to ask in reply whether he had any means of knowing
whether that was her opinion of herself, which caused the Mohammedan to
confess that there lay the mystery: she had been often overheard in
prayer confessing herself the most unworthy of sinners.

To return from this digression, Mr. Müller, not only during this
illness, but down to life''s sudden close, had a growing sense of sin and
guilt which would at times have been overwhelming, had he not known upon
the testimony of the Word that "whoso covereth his sins shall not
prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall find mercy."
From his own guilt he turned his eyes to the cross where it was atoned
for, and to the mercy-seat where forgiveness meets the penitent sinner;
and so sorrow for sin was turned into the joy of the justified.

This confidence of acceptance in the Beloved so stripped death of its
terrors that during this illness he longed rather to depart and to be
with Christ; but after a fortnight he was pronounced better, and, though
still longing for the heavenly rest, he submitted to the will of God for
a longer sojourn in the land of his pilgrimage, little foreseeing what
joy he was to find in living for God, or how much he was to know of the
days of heaven upon earth.

During this illness, also, he showed the growing tendency to bring
before the Lord in prayer even the minutest matters which his later life
so signally exhibited. He constantly besought God to guide his
physician, and every new dose of medicine was accompanied by a new
petition that God would use it for his good and enable him with patience
to await His will. As he advanced toward recovery he sought rest at
Teignmouth, where, shortly after his arrival, "Ebenezer" chapel was
reopened. It was here also that Mr. Müller became acquainted with Mr.
Henry Craik, who was for so many years not only his friend, but fellow
labourer.

It was also about this time that, as he records, certain great truths
began to be made clear to him and to stand out in much prominence. This
period of personal preparation is so important in its bearing on his
whole after-career that the reader should have access to his own
witness.*

On returning to London, prospered in soul-health as also in bodily
vigor, he proposed to fellow students a daily morning meeting, from 6 to
8, for prayer and Bible study, when each should give to the others such
views of any passage read as the Lord might give him. These spiritual
exercises proved so helpful and so nourished the appetite for divine
things that, after continuing in prayer late into the evening hours, he
sometimes at midnight sought the fellowship of some like-minded brother,
and thus prolonged the prayer season until one or two o''clock in the
morning; and even then sleep was often further postponed by his
overflowing joy in God. Thus, under his great Teacher, did this pupil,
early in his spiritual history, learn that supreme lesson that to every
child of God the word of God is the bread of life, and the prayer of
faith the breath of life.

Mr. Müller had been back in London scarcely ten days before health again
declined, and the conviction took strong hold upon him that he should
not spend his little strength in confining study, but at once get about
his work; and this conviction was confirmed by the remembrance of the
added light which God had given him and the deeper passion he now felt
to serve Him more freely and fully. Under the pressure of this
persuasion that both his physical and spiritual welfare would be
promoted by actual labours for souls, he sought of the Society a prompt
appointment to his field of service; and that they might with the more
confidence commission him, he asked that some experienced man might be
sent out with him as a fellow counsellor and labourer.

After waiting in vain for six weeks for an answer to this application,
he felt another strong conviction: that to wait on his fellow men to be
sent out to his field and work was unscriptural and therefore wrong.
Barnabas and Saul were called by name and sent forth by the Holy Spirit,
before the church at Antioch had taken any action; and he felt himself
so called of the Spirit to his work that he was prompted to begin at
once, without waiting for human authority,—and why not among the Jews
in London? Accustomed to act promptly upon conviction, he undertook to
distribute among them tracts bearing his name and address, so that any
who wished personal guidance could find him. He sought them at their
gathering-places, read the Scriptures at stated times with some fifty
Jewish lads, and taught in a Sunday-school. Thus, instead of lying like
a vessel in dry-dock for repairs, he was launched into Christian work,
though, like other labourers among the despised Jews, he found himself
exposed to petty trials and persecutions, called to suffer reproach for
the name of Christ.

Before the autumn of 1829 had passed, a further misgiving laid hold of
him as to whether he could in good conscience remain longer connected in
the usual way with this London Society, and on December 12th he
concluded to dissolve all such ties except upon certain conditions. To
do full justice both to Mr. Müller and the Society, his own words will
again be found in the Appendix.*

Early in the following year it was made clear that he could labour in
connection with such a society only as they would consent to his
serving without salary and labouring when and where the Lord might seem
to direct. He so wrote, eliciting a firm but kind response to the
effect that they felt it "inexpedient to employ those who were unwilling
to submit to their guidance with respect to missionary operations," etc.

Thus this link with the Society was broken. He felt that he was acting
up to the light God gave, and, while imputing to the Society no blame,
he never afterward repented this step nor reversed this judgment. To
those who review this long life, so full of the fruits of unusual
service to God and man, it will be quite apparent that the Lord was
gently but persistently thrusting George Müller out of the common path
into one where he was to walk very closely with Himself; and the
decisions which, even in lesser matters furthered God''s purpose were
wiser and weightier than could at the time be seen.

One is constantly reminded in reading Mr. Müller''s journal that he was a
man of like frailties as others. On Christmas morning of this year,
after a season of peculiar joy, he awoke to find himself in the Slough
of Despond, without any sense of enjoyment, prayer seeming as fruitless
as the vain struggles of a man in the mire. At the usual morning meeting
he was urged by a brother to continue in prayer, notwithstanding, until
he was again melted before the Lord—a wise counsel for all disciples
when the Lord''s presence seems strangely withdrawn. Steadfast
continuance in prayer must never be hindered by the want of sensible
enjoyment; in fact, it is a safe maxim that the less joy, the more need.
Cessation of communion with God, for whatever cause, only makes the more
difficult its resumption and the recovery of the prayer habit and prayer
spirit; whereas the persistent outpouring of supplication, together with
continued activity in the service of God, soon brings back the lost joy.
Whenever, therefore, one yields to spiritual depression so as to
abandon, or even to suspend, closet communion or Christian work, the
devil triumphs.

So rapid was Mr. Müller''s recovery out of this Satanic snare, through
continuance in prayer, that, on the evening of that same Christmas day
whose dawn had been so overcast, he expounded the Word at family worship
in the house where he dined by invitation, and with such help from God
that two servants who were present were deeply convicted of sin and
sought his counsel.

Here we reach another mile-stone in this life-journey. George Müller had
now come to the end of the year 1829, and he had been led of the Lord in
a truly remarkable path. It was but about four years since he first
found the narrow way and began to walk in it, and he was as yet a young
man, in his twenty-fifth year. Yet already he had been taught some of
the grand secrets of a holy, happy, and useful life, which became the
basis of the whole structure of his after-service.

Indeed, as we look back over these four years, they seem crowded with
significant and eventful experiences, all of which forecast his future
work, though he as yet saw not in them the Lord''s sign. His conversion
in a primitive assembly of believers where worship and the word of God
were the only attractions, was the starting-point in a career every step
of which seems a stride forward. Think of a young convert, with such an
ensnaring past to reproach and retard him, within these few years
learning such advanced lessons in renunciation: burning his manuscript
novel, giving up the girl he loved, turning his back on the seductive
prospect of ease and wealth, to accept self-denial for God, cutting
loose from dependence on his father and then refusing all stated salary
lest his liberty of witness be curtailed, and choosing a simple
expository mode of preaching, instead of catering to popular taste! Then
mark how he fed on the word of God; how he cultivated the habits of
searching the Scriptures and praying in secret; how he threw himself on
God, not only for temporal supplies, but for support in bearing all
burdens, however great or small; and how thus early he offered himself
for the mission field and was impatiently eager to enter it. Then look
at the sovereign love of God, imparting to him in so eminent a degree
the childlike spirit, teaching him to trust not his own variable moods
of feeling, but the changeless word of His promise; teaching him to wait
patiently on Him for orders, and not to look to human authority or
direction; and so singularly releasing him from military service for
life, and mysteriously withholding him from the far-off mission field,
that He might train him for his unique mission to the race and the ages
to come!

These are a few of the salient points of this narrative, thus far, which
must, to any candid mind, demonstrate that a higher Hand was moulding
this chosen vessel on His potter''s wheel, and shaping it unmistakably
for the singular service to which it was destined!

No work for God surpasses in dignity and responsibility the Christian
ministry. It is at once the consummate flower of the divine planting,
the priceless dower of His church, and through it works the power of God
for salvation.

Though George Müller had begun his ''candidacy for holy orders'' as an
unconverted man, seeking simply a human calling with a hope of a
lucrative living, he had heard God''s summons to a divine vocation, and
he was from time to time preaching the Gospel, but not in any settled
field.

While at Teignmouth, early in 1830, preaching by invitation, he was
asked to take the place of the minister who was about to leave, but he
replied that he felt at that time called of God, not to a stationary
charge, but rather to a sort of itinerant evangelism. During this time
he preached at Shaldon for Henry Craik, thus coming into closer contact
with this brother, to whom his heart became knit in bonds of love and
sympathy which grew stronger as the acquaintance became more intimate.

Certain hearers at Teignmouth, and among them some preachers, disliked
his sermons, albeit they were owned of God; and this caused him to
reflect upon the probable causes of this opposition, and whether it was
any indication of his duty. He felt that they doubtless looked for
outward graces of oratory in a preacher, and hence were not attracted to
a foreigner whose speech had no rhetorical charms and who could not even
use English with fluency. But he felt sure of a deeper cause for their
dislike, especially as he was compelled to notice that, the summer
previous, when he himself was less spiritually minded and had less
insight into the truth, the same parties who now opposed him were
pleased with him. His final conclusion was that the Lord meant to work
through him at Teignmouth, but that Satan was acting, as usual, the part
of a hinderer, and stirring up brethren themselves to oppose the truth.
And as, notwithstanding the opposers, the wish that he should minister
at the chapel was expressed so often and by so many, he determined to
remain for a time until he was openly rejected as God''s witness, or had
some clear divine leading to another field of labour.

He announced this purpose, at the same time plainly stating that, should
they withhold salary, it would not affect his decision, inasmuch as he
did not preach as a hireling of man, but as the servant of God, and
would willingly commit to Him the provision for his temporal needs. At
the same time, however, he reminded them that it was alike their duty
and privilege to minister in carnal things to those who served them in
things spiritual, and that while he did not desire a gift, he did desire
fruit that might abound to their account.

These experiences at Teignmouth were typical: "Some believed the things
which were spoken, and some believed not;" some left the chapel, while
others stayed; and some were led and fed, while others maintained a cold
indifference, if they did not exhibit an open hostility. But the Lord
stood by him and strengthened him, setting His seal upon his testimony;
and Jehovah Jireh also moved two brethren, unasked, to supply all the
daily wants of His servant. After a while the little church of eighteen
members unanimously called the young preacher to the pastorate, and he
consented to abide with them for a season, without abandoning his
original intention of going from place to place as the Lord might lead.
A stipend, of fifty-five pounds annually, was offered him, which
somewhat increased as the church membership grew; and so the university
student of Halle was settled in his first pulpit and pastorate.

While at Sidmouth, preaching, in April, 1830, three believing sisters
held in his presence a conversation about ''believers'' baptism,'' which
proved the suggestion of another important step in his life, which has a
wider bearing than at first is apparent.

They naturally asked his opinion on the subject about which they were
talking, and he replied that, having been baptized as a child, he saw no
need of being baptized again. Being further asked if he had ever yet
prayerfully searched the word of God as to its testimony in this matter,
he frankly confessed that he had not.

At once, with unmistakable plainness of speech and with rare fidelity,
one of these sisters in Christ promptly said: "I entreat you, then,
never again to speak any more about it till you have done so."

Such a reply George Müller was not the man either to resent or to
resist. He was too honest and conscientious to dismiss without due
reflection any challenge to search the oracles of God for their witness
upon any given question. Moreover, if, at that very time, his preaching
was emphatic in any direction, it was in the boldness with which he
insisted that all pulpit teaching and Christian practice must be
subjected to one great test, namely, the touchstone of the word of
God. Already an Elijah in spirit, his great aim was to repair the
broken-down altar of the Lord, to expose and rebuke all that hindered a
thoroughly scriptural worship and service, and, if possible, to restore
apostolic simplicity of doctrine and life.

As he thought and prayed about this matter, he was forced to admit to
himself that he had never yet earnestly examined the Scriptures for
their teaching as to the position and relation of baptism in the
believer''s life, nor had he even prayed for light upon it. He had
nevertheless repeatedly spoken against believers'' baptism, and so he saw
it to be possible that he might himself have been opposing the teaching
of the Word. He therefore determined to study the subject until he
should reach a final, satisfactory, and scriptural conclusion; and
thenceforth, whether led to defend infant baptism or believers'' baptism,
to do it only on scriptural grounds.

The mode of study which he followed was characteristically simple,
thorough, and business-like, and was always pursued afterward. He first
sought from God the Spirit''s teaching that his eyes might be opened to
the Word''s witness, and his mind illumined; then he set about a
systematic examination of the New Testament from beginning to end. So
far as possible he sought absolutely to rid himself of all bias of
previous opinion or practice, prepossession or prejudice; he prayed and
endeavoured to be free from the influence of human tradition, popular
custom, and churchly sanction, or that more subtle hindrance, personal
pride in his own consistency. He was humble enough to be willing to
retract any erroneous teaching and renounce any false position, and to
espouse that wise maxim: "Don''t be consistent, but simply be true!"
Whatever may have been the case with others who claim to have examined
the same question for themselves, the result in his case was that he
came to the conclusion, and, as he believed, from the word of God and
the Spirit of God, that none but believers are the proper subjects of
baptism, and that only immersion is its proper mode. Two passages of
Scripture were very marked in the prominence which they had in
compelling him to these conclusions, namely: Acts viii. 36-38, and
Romans vi. 3-5. The case of the Ethiopian eunuch strongly convinced him
that baptism is proper, only as the act of a believer confessing Christ;
and the passage in the Epistle to the Romans equally satisfied him that
only immersion in water can express the typical burial with Christ and
resurrection with Him, there and elsewhere made so prominent. He
intended no assault upon brethren who hold other views, when he thus
plainly stated in his journal the honest and unavoidable convictions to
which he came; but he was too loyal both to the word of God and to his
own conscience to withhold his views when so carefully and prayerfully
arrived at through the searching of the Scriptures.

Conviction compelled action, for in him there was no spirit of
compromise; and he was accordingly promptly baptized. Years after, in
reviewing his course, he records the solemn conviction that "of all
revealed truths, not one is more clearly revealed in the Scriptures—not
even the doctrine of justification by faith—and that the subject has
only become obscured by men not having been willing to take the
Scriptures alone to decide the point."

He also bears witness incidentally that not one true friend in the Lord
had ever turned his back upon him in consequence of his baptism, as he
supposed some would have done; and that almost all such friends had,
since then, been themselves baptized. It is true that in one way he
suffered some pecuniary loss through this step taken in obedience to
conviction, but the Lord did not suffer him to be ultimately the loser
even in this respect, for He bountifully made up to him any such
sacrifice, even in things that pertain to this life. He concludes this
review of his course by adding that through his example many others were
led both to examine the question of baptism anew and to submit
themselves to the ordinance.

Such experiences as these suggest the honest question whether there is
not imperative need of subjecting all current religious customs and
practices to the one test of conformity to the scripture pattern. Our
Lord sharply rebuked the Pharisees of His day for making "the
commandment of God of none effect by their tradition," and, after giving
one instance, He added, "and many other such like things do ye."* It is
very easy for doctrines and practices to gain acceptance, which are the
outgrowth of ecclesiasticism, and neither have sanction in the word of
God, nor will bear the searching light of its testimony. Cyprian has
forewarned us that even antiquity is not authority, but may be only
vetustas erroris—the old age of error. What radical reforms would be
made in modern worship, teaching and practice,—in the whole conduct of
disciples and the administration of the church of God,—if the one final
criterion of all judgment were: What do the Scriptures teach?'' And what
revolutions in our own lives as believers might take place, if we should
first put every notion of truth and custom of life to this one test of
scripture authority, and then with the courage of conviction dare to do
according to that word—counting no cost, but studying to show ourselves
approved of God! Is it possible that there are any modern disciples who
"reject the commandment of God that they may keep their own tradition"?

This step, taken by Mr. Müller as to baptism, was only a precursor of
many others, all of which, as he believed, were according to that Word
which, as the lamp to the believer''s feet, is to throw light upon his
path.

During this same summer of 1830 the further study of the Word satisfied
him that, though there is no direct command so to do, the scriptural
and apostolic practice was to break bread every Lord''s day. (Acts xx
7, etc.) Also, that the Spirit of God should have unhindered liberty to
work through any believer according to the gifts He had bestowed, seemed
to him plainly taught in Romans xii.; 1 Cor. xii.; Ephes. iv., etc.
These conclusions likewise this servant of God sought to translate at
once into conduct, and such conformity brought increasing spiritual
prosperity.

Conscientious misgivings, about the same time, ripened into settled
convictions that he could no longer, upon the same principle of
obedience to the word of God, consent to receive any stated salary as
a minister of Christ. For this latter position, which so influenced his
life, he assigns the following grounds, which are here stated as showing
the basis of his life-long attitude:

1. A stated salary implies a fixed sum, which cannot well be paid
without a fixed income through pew-rentals or some like source of
revenue. This seemed plainly at war with the teaching of the Spirit of
God in James ii. 1-6, since the poor brother cannot afford as good
sittings as the rich, thus introducing into church assemblies invidious
distinctions and respect of persons, and so encouraging the caste
spirit.

2. A fixed pew-rental may at times become, even to the willing disciple,
a burden. He who would gladly contribute to a pastor''s support, if
allowed to do so according to his ability and at his own convenience,
might be oppressed by the demand to pay a stated sum at a stated time.
Circumstances so change that one who has the same cheerful mind as
before may be unable to give as formerly, and thus be subjected to
painful embarrassment and humiliation if constrained to give a fixed
sum.

3. The whole system tends to the bondage of the servant of Christ. One
must be unusually faithful and intrepid if he feels no temptation to
keep back or in some degree modify his message in order to please men,
when he remembers that the very parties, most open to rebuke and most
liable to offence, are perhaps the main contributors toward his salary.

Whatever others may think of such reasons as these, they were so
satisfactory to his mind that he frankly and promptly announced them to
his brethren; and thus, as early as the autumn of 1830, when just
completing his twenty-fifth year, he took a position from which he never
retreated, that he would thenceforth receive no fixed salary for any
service rendered to God''s people. While calmly assigning scriptural
grounds for such a position he, on the same grounds, urged voluntary
offerings, whether of money or other means of support, as the proper
acknowledgment of service rendered by God''s minister, and as a sacrifice
acceptable, well-pleasing to God. A little later, seeing that, when such
voluntary gifts came direct from the givers personally, there was a
danger that some might feel self-complacent over the largeness of the
amount given by them, and others equally humbled by the smallness of
their offerings, with consequent damage to both classes, of givers, he
took a step further: he had a box put up in the chapel, over which was
written, that whoever had a desire to do something for his support might
put such an offering therein as ability and disposition might direct.
His intention was, that thus the act might be wholly as in God''s sight,
without the risk of a sinful pride or false humility.

He further felt that, to be entirely consistent, he should ask no help
from man, even in bearing necessary costs of travel in the Lord''s
service, nor even state his needs beforehand in such a way as indirectly
to appeal for aid. All of these methods he conceived to be forms of
trusting in an arm of flesh, going to man for help instead of going at
once, always and only, to the Lord. And he adds: "To come to this
conclusion before God required more grace than to give up my salary."

These successive steps are here recorded explicitly and in their exact
order because they lead up directly to the ultimate goal of his
life-work and witness. Such decisions were vital links connecting this
remarkable man and his "Father''s business," upon which he was soon more
fully to enter; and they were all necessary to the fulness of the
world-wide witness which he was to bear to a prayer-hearing God and the
absolute safety of trusting in Him and in Him alone.

On October 7, 1830, George Müller, in finding a wife, found a good thing
and obtained new favour from the Lord. Miss Mary Groves, sister of the
self-denying dentist whose surrender of all things for the mission field
had so impressed him years before, was married to this man of God, and
for forty blessed years proved an help meet for him. It was almost, if
not quite, an ideal union, for which he continually thanked God; and,
although her kingdom was one which came not with observation,'' the
sceptre of her influence was far wider in its sway than will ever be
appreciated by those who were strangers to her personal and domestic
life. She was a rare woman and her price was above rubies. The heart of
her husband safely trusted, in her, and the great family of orphans who
were to her as children rise up even to this day to call her blessed.

Married life has often its period of estrangement, even when temporary
alienation yields to a deeper love, as the parties become more truly
wedded by the assimilation of their inmost being to one another. But to
Mr. and Mrs. Müller there never came any such experience of even
temporary alienation. From the first, love grew, and with it, mutual
confidence and trust. One of the earliest ties which bound these two in
one was the bond of a common self-denial. Yielding literal obedience
to Luke xii. 33, they sold what little they had and gave alms,
henceforth laying up no treasures on earth (Matthew vi. 19-34; xix. 21.)
The step then taken—accepting, for Christ''s sake, voluntary
poverty—was never regretted, but rather increasingly rejoiced in; how
faithfully it was followed in the same path of continued self-sacrifice
will sufficiently appear when it is remembered that, nearly sixty-eight
years afterward, George Müller passed suddenly into the life beyond, a
poor man; his will, when admitted to probate, showing his entire
personal property, under oath, to be but one hundred and sixty pounds!
And even that would not have been in his possession had there been no
daily need of requisite comforts for the body and of tools for his work.
Part of this amount was in money, shortly before received and not yet
laid out for his Master, but held at His disposal. Nothing, even to the
clothes he wore, did he treat as his own. He was a consistent steward.

This final farewell to all earthly possessions, in 1830, left this
newly married husband and wife to look only to the Lord. Thenceforth
they were to put to ample daily test both their faith in the Great
Provider and the faithfulness of the Great Promiser. It may not be
improper here to anticipate, what is yet to be more fully recorded,
that, from day to day and hour to hour, during more than threescore
years, George Müller was enabled to set to his seal that God is true. If
few men have ever been permitted so to trace in the smallest matters
God''s care over His children, it is partly because few have so
completely abandoned themselves to that care. He dared to trust Him,
with whom the hairs of our head are all numbered, and who touchingly
reminds us that He cares for what has been quaintly called "the odd
sparrow." Matthew records (x. 29) how two sparrows are sold for a
farthing, and Luke (xii. 6) how five are sold for two farthings; and so
it would appear that, when two farthings were offered, an odd sparrow
was thrown in, as of so little value that it could be given away with
the other four. And yet even for that one sparrow, not worth taking into
account in the bargain, God cares. Not one of them is forgotten before
God, or falls to the ground without Him. With what force then comes the
assurance: "Fear ye not therefore; ye are of more value than many
sparrows!"

So George Müller found it to be. He was permitted henceforth to know as
never before, and as few others have ever learned, how truly God may be
approached as "Thou that hearest prayer." God can keep His trusting
children not only from falling but from stumbling; for, during all those
after-years that spanned the lifetime of two generations, there was no
drawing back. Those precious promises, which in faith and hope were
"laid hold" of in 1830, were "held fast" until the end. (Heb. vi. 18, x.
23.) And the divine faithfulness proved a safe anchorage-ground in the
most prolonged and violent tempests. The anchor of hope, sure and
steadfast, and entering into that within the veil, was never dragged
from its secure hold on God. In fifty thousand cases, Mr. Müller
calculated that he could trace distinct answers to definite prayers; and
in multitudes of instances in which God''s care was not definitely
traced, it was day by day like an encompassing passing but invisible
presence or atmosphere of life and strength.

On August 9, 1831, Mrs. Müller gave birth to a stillborn babe, and for
six weeks remained seriously ill. Her husband meanwhile laments that his
heart was so cold and carnal, and his prayers often so hesitating and
formal; and he detects, even behind his zeal for God, most unspiritual
frames. He especially chides himself for not having more seriously
thought of the peril of child-bearing, so as to pray more earnestly for
his wife; and he saw clearly that the prospect of parenthood had not
been rejoiced in as a blessing, but rather as implying a new burden and
hindrance in the Lord''s work.

While this man of God lays bare his heart in his journal, the reader
must feel that "as in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man
to man." How many a servant of God has no more exalted idea of the
divine privilege of a sanctified parenthood! A wife and a child are most
precious gifts of God when received, in answer to prayer, from His hand.
Not only are they not hindrances, but they are helps, most useful in
fitting a servant of Christ for certain parts of his work for which no
other preparation is so adequate. They serve to teach him many most
valuable lessons, and to round out his character into a far more
symmetrical beauty and serviceableness. And when it is remembered how a
godly association in holiness and usefulness may thus be supplied, and
above all a godly succession through many generations, it will be seen
how wicked is the spirit that treats holy wedlock and its fruits in
offspring,—with lightness and contempt. Nor let us forget that promise:
"If two of you agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask,
it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven." (Matt.
xviii. 19.) The Greek word for "agree" is symphonize, and suggests a
musical harmony where chords are tuned to the same key and struck by a
master hand. Consider what a blessed preparation for such habitual
symphony in prayer is to be found in the union of a husband and wife in
the Lord! May it not be that to this the Spirit refers when He bids
husband and wife dwell in unity, as "heirs together of the grace of
life," and adds, "that your prayers be not hindered"? (1 Peter iii.
7.)

God used this severe lesson for permanent blessing to George Müller. He
showed him how open was his heart to the subtle power of selfishness and
carnality, and how needful was this chastisement to teach him the
sacredness of marital life and parental responsibility. Henceforth he
judged himself, that he might not be "judged of the Lord." (1 Cor. xi.
31.)

A crisis like his wife''s critical illness created a demand for much
extra expense, for which no provision had been made, not through
carelessness and improvidence, but upon principle. Mr. Müller held that
to lay by in store is inconsistent with full trust in God, who in such
case would send us to our hoardings before answering prayer for more
supplies. Experience in this emergency justified his faith; for not only
were all unforeseen wants supplied, but even the delicacies and
refreshments needful for the sick and weak; and the two medical
attendants graciously declined all remuneration for services which
extended through six weeks. Thus was there given of the Lord more than
could have been laid up against this season of trial, even had the
attempt been made.

The principle of committing future wants to the Lord''s care, thus acted
upon at this time, he and his wife consistently followed so long as they
lived and worked together. Experience confirmed them in the conviction
that a life of trust forbids laying up treasures against unforeseen
foreseen needs, since with God no emergency is unforeseen and no want
unprovided for; and He may be as implicitly trusted for
extraordinary needs as for our common daily bread.

Yet another law, kindred to this and thoroughly inwrought into Mr.
Müller''s habit of life, was never to contract debt, whether for
personal purposes or the Lord''s work. This matter was settled on
scriptural grounds once for all (Romans xiii. 8), and he and his wife
determined if need be to suffer starvation rather than to buy anything
without paying for it when bought. Thus they always knew how much they
had to buy with, and what they had left to give to others or use for
others'' wants.

There was yet another law of life early framed into Mr. Müller''s
personal decalogue. He regarded any money which was in his hands
already designated for, or appropriated to, a specific use, as not
his to use, even temporarily, for any other ends. Thus, though he was
often reduced to the lowest point of temporal supplies, he took no
account of any such funds set apart for other outlays or due for other
purposes. Thousands of times he was in straits where such diversion of
funds for a time seemed the only and the easy way out, but where this
would only have led him into new embarrassments. This principle,
intelligently adopted, was firmly adhered to, that what properly belongs
to a particular branch of work, or has been already put aside for a
certain use, even though yet in hand, is not to be reckoned on as
available for any other need, however pressing. Trust in God implies
such knowledge on His part of the exact circumstances that He will not
constrain us to any such misappropriation. Mistakes, most serious and
fatal, have come from lack of conscience as well as of faith in such
exigencies—drawing on one fund to meet the overdraught upon another,
hoping afterward to replace what is thus withdrawn. A well-known college
president had nearly involved the institution of which he was the head,
in bankruptcy, and himself in worse moral ruin, all the result of one
error—money given for endowing certain chairs had been used for current
expenses until public confidence had been almost hopelessly impaired.

Thus a life of faith must be no less a life of conscience. Faith and
trust in God, and truth and faithfulness toward man, walked side by side
in this life-journey in unbroken agreement.

The record written by George Müller of the Lord''s dealings reads,
especially in parts, almost like an inspired writing, because it is
simply the tracing of divine guidance in a human life—not this man''s
own working or planning, suffering or serving, but the Lord''s dealings
with him and workings through him.

It reminds us of that conspicuous passage in the Acts of the Apostles
where, within the compass of twenty verses, God is fifteen times put
boldly forward as the one Actor in all events. Paul and Barnabas
rehearsed, in the ears of the church at Antioch, and afterward at
Jerusalem, not what they had done for the Lord, but all that He had
done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith unto the
Gentiles; what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles
by them. And, in the same spirit, Peter before the council emphasizes
how God had made choice of his mouth, as that whereby the Gentiles
should hear the word of the Gospel and believe; how He had given them
the Holy Ghost and put no difference between Jew and Gentile, purifying
their hearts by faith; and how He who knew all hearts had thus borne
them witness. Then James, in the same strain, refers to the way in which
God had visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His
name; and concludes by two quotations or adaptations from the Old
Testament, which fitly sum up the whole matter:

The meaning of such repeated phraseology cannot be mistaken. God is here
presented as the one agent or actor, and even the most conspicuous
apostles, like Paul and Peter, as only His instruments. No twenty verses
in the word of God contain more emphatic and repeated lessons on man''s
insufficiency and nothingness, and God''s all-sufficiency and
almightiness. It was God that wrought upon man through man. It was He
who chose Peter to be His mouthpiece, He whose key unlocked shut doors,
He who visited the nations, who turned sinners into saints, who was even
then taking out a people for His name, purifying hearts and bearing them
witness; it was He and He alone who did all these wondrous things, and
according to His knowledge and plan of what He would do, from the
beginning. We are not reading so much the Acts of the Apostles as the
acts of God through the apostles. Was it not this very passage in this
inspired book that suggested, perhaps, the name of this journal: "The
Lord''s dealings with George Müller"?

At this narrative or journal, as a whole, we can only rapidly glance. In
this shorter account, purposely condensed to secure a wider reading even
from busy people, that narrative could not be more fully treated, for in
its original form it covers about three thousand printed pages, and
contains close to one million words. To such as can and will read that
more minute account it is accessible at a low rate,* and is strongly
recommended for careful and leisurely perusal. But for the present
purpose the life-story, as found in these pages, takes both a briefer
and a different form.

* Five volumes at 16s. Published by Jas. Nisbet & Co., London. With
subsequent Annual Reports at 3d. each.

The journal is largely composed of, condensed from, and then
supplemented by, annual reports of the work, and naturally and
necessarily includes, not only thousands of little details, but much
inevitable repetition year by year, because each new report was likely
to fall into the hands of some who had never read reports of the
previous years. The desire and design of this briefer memoir is to
present the salient points of the narrative, to review the whole
life-story as from the great summits or outlooks found in this
remarkable journal; so that, like the observer who from some high
mountain-peak looks toward the different points of the compass, and thus
gets a rapid, impressive, comparative, and comprehensive view of the
whole landscape, the reader may, as at a glance, take in those marked
features of this godly man''s character and career which incite to new
and advance steps in faith and holy living. Some few characteristic
entries in the journal will find here a place; others, only in
substance; while of the bulk of them it will be sufficient to give a
general survey, classifying the leading facts, and under each class
giving a few representative examples and illustrations.

Looking at this narrative as a whole, certain prominent peculiarities
must be carefully noted. We have here a record and revelation of seven
conspicuous experiences:

The money in hand for personal needs, and for the needs of hundreds and
thousands of orphans, and for the various branches of the work of the
Scriptural Knowledge Institution, was often reduced to a single pound,
or even penny, and sometimes to nothing. There was therefore a
necessity for constant waiting on God, looking to Him directly for all
supplies. For months, if not years, together, and at several periods in
the work, supplies were furnished only from month to month, week to
week, day to day, hour to hour! Faith was thus kept in lively exercise
and under perpetual training.

The straits were long and trying, but never was there one case of
failure to receive help; never a meal-time without at least a frugal
meal, never a want or a crisis unmet by divine supply and support. Mr.
Müller said to the writer: "Not once, or five times, or five hundred
times, but thousands of times in these threescore years, have we had in
hand not enough for one more meal, either in food or in funds; but not
once has God failed us; not once have we or the orphans gone hungry or
lacked any good thing." From 1838 to 1844 was a period of peculiar and
prolonged straits, yet when the time of need actually came the supply
was always given, though often at the last moment.

3. An experience of the working of God upon the minds, hearts, and
consciences of contributors to the work.

It will amply repay one to plod, step by step, over these thousands of
pages, if only to trace the hand of God touching the springs of human
action all over the world in ways of His own, and at times of great
need, and adjusting the amount and the exact day and hour of the supply,
to the existing want. Literally from the earth''s ends, men, women, and
children who had never seen Mr. Müller and could have known nothing of
the pressure at the time, have been led at the exact crisis of affairs
to send aid in the very sum or form most needful. In countless cases,
while he was on his knees asking, the answer has come in such close
correspondence with the request as to shut out chance as an explanation,
and compel belief in a prayer-hearing God.

The reports, issued annually to acquaint the public with the history and
progress of the work, and give an account of stewardship to the many
donors who had a right to a report—these made no direct appeal for
aid. At one time, and that of great need, Mr. Müller felt led to
withhold the usual annual statement, lest some might construe the
account of work already done as an appeal for aid in work yet to be
done, and thus detract from the glory of the Great Provider.* The Living
God alone was and is the Patron of these institutions; and not even the
wisest and wealthiest, the noblest and the most influential of human
beings, has ever been looked to as their dependence.

* For example, Vol. II, 102, records that the report given is for
1846-1848, no report having been issued for 1847; and on page 113, under
date of May 25th, occur these words: "not being nearly enough to meet
the housekeeping expenses," etc.; and, May 28th and 30th, such other
words as these: "now our poverty," "in this our great need," "in these
days of straitness." Mr. Wright thinks that on that very account Mr.
Müller did not publish the report for 1847.

Here is a pattern for all who act as stewards for God. Whenever there
was any ground of misgiving as to the propriety or expediency of
receiving what was offered, it was declined, however pressing the need,
unless or until all such objectionable features no more existed. If the
party contributing was known to dishonour lawful debts, so that the
money was righteously due to others; if the gift was encumbered and
embarrassed by restrictions that hindered its free use for God; if it
was designated for endowment purposes or as a provision for Mr. Müller''s
old age, or for the future of the institutions; or if there was any
evidence or suspicion that the donation was given grudgingly,
reluctantly, or for self-glory, it was promptly declined and returned.
In some cases, even where large amounts were involved, parties were
urged to wait until more prayer and deliberation made clear that they
were acting under divine leading.

6. An experience of extreme caution lest there should be even a careless
betrayal of the fact of pressing need, to the outside public.

The helpers in the institutions were allowed to come into such close
fellowship and to have such knowledge of the exact state of the work as
aids not only in common labours, but in common prayers and self-denials.
Without such acquaintance they could not serve, pray, nor sacrifice
intelligently. But these associates were most solemnly and repeatedly
charged never to reveal to those without, not even in the most serious
crises, any want whatsoever of the work. The one and only resort was
ever to be the God who hears the cry of the needy; and the greater the
exigency, the greater the caution lest there should even seem to be a
looking away from divine to human help.

As faith was exercised it was energized, so that it became as easy and
natural to ask confidently for a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand
pounds, as once it had been for a pound or a penny. After confidence in
God had been strengthened through discipline, and God had been proven
faithful, it required no more venture to cast himself on God for
provision for two thousand children and an annual outlay of at least
twenty-five thousand pounds for them than in the earlier periods of the
work to look to Him to care for twenty homeless orphans at a cost of two
hundred and fifty pounds a year. Only by using faith are we kept from
practically losing it, and, on the contrary, to use faith is to lose
the unbelief that hinders God''s mighty acts.

This brief resume of the contents of thousands of entries is the result
of a repeated and careful examination of page after page where have been
patiently recorded with scrupulous and punctilious exactness the
innumerable details of Mr. Müller''s long experience as a coworker with
God. He felt himself not only the steward of a celestial Master, but the
trustee of human gifts, and hence he sought to "provide things honest in
the sight of all men." He might never have published a report or spread
these minute matters before the public eye, and yet have been an equally
faithful steward toward God; but he would not in such case have been
an equally faithful trustee toward man.

Frequently, in these days, men receive considerable sums of money from
various sources for benevolent work, and yet give no account of such
trusteeship. However honest such parties may be, they not only act
unwisely, but, by their course, lend sanction to others with whom such
irresponsible action is a cloak for systematic fraud. Mr. Müller''s whole
career is the more without fault because in this respect his
administration of his great trust challenges the closest investigation.

The brief review of the lessons taught in his journal may well startle
the incredulous and unbelieving spirit of our skeptical day. Those who
doubt the power of prayer to bring down actual blessing, or who confound
faith in God with credulity and superstition, may well wonder and
perhaps stumble at such an array of facts. But, if any reader is still
doubtful as to the facts, or thinks they are here arrayed in a deceptive
garb or invested with an imaginative halo, he is hereby invited to
examine for himself the singularly minute records which George Müller
has been led of God to put before the world in a printed form which thus
admits no change, and to accompany with a bold and repeated challenge to
any one so inclined, to subject every statement to the severest
scrutiny, and prove, if possible, one item to be in any respect false,
exaggerated, or misleading. The absence of all enthusiasm in the calm
and mathematical precision of the narrative compels the reader to feel
that the writer was almost mechanically exact in the record, and
inspires confidence that it contains the absolute, naked truth.

One caution should, like Habakkuk''s gospel message—"The just shall live
by his faith"—be written large and plain so that even a cursory glance
may take it in. Let no one ascribe to George Müller such a miraculous
gift of faith as lifted him above common believers and out of the reach
of the temptations and infirmities to which all fallible souls are
exposed. He was constantly liable to satanic assaults, and we find him
making frequent confession of the same sins as others, and even of
unbelief, and at times overwhelmed with genuine sorrow for his
departures from God. In fact he felt himself rather more than usually
wicked by nature, and utterly helpless even as a believer: was it not
this poverty of spirit and mourning over sin, this consciousness of
entire unworthiness and dependence, that so drove him to the throne of
grace and the all-merciful and all-powerful Father? Because he was so
weak, he leaned hard on the strong arm of Him whose strength is not only
manifested, but can only be made perfect, in weakness.*

To those who think that no man can wield such power in prayer or live
such a life of faith who is not an exception to common mortal frailties,
it will be helpful to find in this very journal that is so lighted up
with the records of God''s goodness, the dark shadows of conscious sin
and guilt. Even in the midst of abounding mercies and interpositions he
suffered from temptations to distrust and disobedience, and sometimes
had to mourn their power over him, as when once he found himself
inwardly complaining of the cold leg of mutton which formed the staple
of his Sunday dinner! We discover as we read that we are communing with
a man who was not only of like passions with ourselves, but who felt
himself rather more than most others subject to the sway of evil, and
needing therefore a special keeping power. Scarce had he started upon
his new path of entire dependence on God, when he confessed himself "so
sinful" as for some time to entertain the thought that "it would be of
no use to trust in the Lord in this way," and fearing that he had
perhaps gone already too far in this direction in having committed
himself to such a course.* True, this temptation was speedily overcome
and Satan confounded; but from time to time similar fiery darts were
hurled at him which had to be quenched by the same shield of faith.
Never, to the last hour of life, could he trust himself, or for one
moment relax his hold on God, and neglect the word of God and prayer,
without falling into sin. The ''old man,'' of sin always continued too
strong for George Müller alone, and the longer he lived a ''life of
trust'' the less was his trust placed upon himself.

Another fact that grows more conspicuous with the perusal of every new
page in his journal is that in things common and small, as well as
uncommon and great, he took no step without first asking counsel of the
oracles of God and seeking guidance from Him in believing prayer. It was
his life-motto to learn the will of God before undertaking anything, and
to wait till it is clear, because only so can one either be blessed in
his own soul or prospered in the work of his hands.* Many disciples who
are comparatively bold to seek God''s help in great crises, fail to come
to Him with like boldness in matters that seem too trivial to occupy the
thought of God or invite the interposition of Him who numbers the very
hairs of our heads and suffers not one hair to perish. The writer of
this journal escaped this great snare and carried even the smallest
matter to the Lord.

Again, in his journal he constantly seeks to save from reproach the good
name of Him whom he serves: he cannot have such a God accounted a hard
Master. So early as July, 1831, a false rumour found circulation that he
and his wife were half-starving and that certain bodily ailments were
the result of a lack of the necessities of life; and he is constrained
to put on record that, though often brought so low as not to have one
penny left and to have the last bread on the table, they had never yet
sat down to a meal unprovided with some nourishing food. This witness
was repeated from time to time, and until just before his departure for
the Father''s house on high; and it may therefore be accepted as covering
that whole life of faith which reached over nearly threescore years and
ten.

A kindred word of testimony, first given at this same time and in like
manner reiterated from point to point in his pilgrimage, concerns the
Lord''s faithfulness in accompanying His word with power, in accordance
with that positive and unequivocal promise in Isaiah lv. 11: "My word
shall not return unto Me void; but it shall accomplish that which I
please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." It is very
noticeable that this is not said of man''s word, however wise,
important, or sincere, but of God''s word. We are therefore justified
in both expecting and claiming that, just so far as our message is not
of human invention or authority, but is God''s message through us, it
shall never fail to accomplish His pleasure and its divine errand,
whatever be its apparent failure at the time. Mr. Müller, referring to
his own preaching, bears witness that in almost if not quite every place
where he spoke God''s word, whether in larger chapels or smaller rooms,
the Lord gave the seal of His own testimony. He observed, however, that
blessing did not so obviously or abundantly follow his open-air
services: only in one instance had it come to his knowledge that there
were marked results, and that was in the case of an army officer who
came to make sport. Mr. Müller thought that it might please the Lord not
to let him see the real fruit of his work in open-air meetings, or that
there had not been concerning them enough believing prayer; but he
concluded that such manner of preaching was not his present work, since
God had not so conspicuously sealed it with blessing.

His journal makes very frequent reference to the physical weakness and
disability from which he suffered.

The struggle against bodily infirmity was almost life-long, and adds a
new lesson to his life-story. The strength of faith had to triumph over
the weakness of the flesh. We often find him suffering from bodily ills,
and sometimes so seriously as to be incapacitated for labour.

For example, early in 1832 he broke a blood-vessel in the stomach and
lost much blood by the hemorrhage. The very day following was the Lord''s
day, and four outside preaching stations needed to be provided for, from
which his disablement would withdraw one labourer to take his place at
home. After an hour of prayer he felt that faith was given him to rise,
dress, and go to the chapel; and, though very weak, so that the short
walk wearied him, he was helped to preach as usual. After the service a
medical friend remonstrated against his course as tending to permanent
injury; but he replied that he should himself have regarded it
presumptuous had not the Lord given him the faith. He preached both
afternoon and evening, growing stronger rather than weaker with each
effort, and suffering from no reaction afterward.

In reading Mr. Müller''s biography and the record of such experiences, it
is not probable that all will agree as to the wisdom of his course in
every case. Some will commend, while others will, perhaps, condemn. He
himself qualifies this entry in his journal with a wholesome caution
that no reader should in such a matter follow his example, who has not
faith given him; but assuring him that if God does give faith so to
undertake for Him, such trust will prove like good coin and be honoured
when presented. He himself did not always pursue a like course, because
he had not always a like faith, and this leads him in his journal to
draw a valuable distinction between the gift of faith and the grace
of faith, which deserves careful consideration.

He observed that repeatedly he prayed with the sick till they were
restored, he asking unconditionally for the blessing of bodily health,
a thing which, he says, later on, he could not have done. Almost always
in such cases the petition was granted, yet in some instances not. Once,
in his own case, as early as 1829, he had been healed of a bodily
infirmity of long standing, and which never returned. Yet this same man
of God subsequently suffered from disease which was not in like manner
healed, and in more than one case submitted to a costly operation at the
hands of a skilful surgeon.

Some will doubtless say that even this man of faith lacked the faith
necessary for the healing of his own body; but we must let him speak for
himself, and especially as he gives his own view of the gift and the
grace of faith. He says that the gift of faith is exercised, whenever
we "do or believe a thing where the not doing or not believing would
not be sin"; but the grace of faith, "where we do or believe what
not to do or believe would be sin"; in one case we have no unequivocal
command or promise to guide us, and in the other we have. The gift of
faith is not always in exercise, but the grace must be, since it has the
definite word of God to rest on, and the absence or even weakness of
faith in such circumstances implies sin. There were instances, he adds,
in which it pleased the Lord at times to bestow upon him something like
the gift of faith so that he could ask unconditionally and expect
confidently.

This journal we may now dismiss as a whole, having thus looked at the
general features which characterize its many pages. But let it be
repeated that to any reader who will for himself carefully examine its
contents its perusal will prove a means of grace. To read a little at a
time, and follow it with reflection and self-examination, will be found
most stimulating to faith, though often most humiliating by reason of
the conscious contrast suggested by the reader''s unbelief and
unfaithfulness. This man lived peculiarly with God and in God, and his
senses were exercised to discern good and evil. His conscience became
increasingly sensitive and his judgment singularly discriminating, so
that he detected fallacies where they escape the common eye, and foresaw
dangers which, like hidden rocks ahead, risk damage and, perhaps,
destruction to service if not to character. And, therefore, so far is
the writer of this memoir from desiring to displace that journal, that
he rather seeks to incite many who have not read it to examine it for
themselves. It will to such be found to mark a path of close daily walk
with God, where, step by step, with circumspect vigilance, conduct and
even motive are watched and weighed in God''s own balances.

To sum up very briefly the impression made by the close perusal of this
whole narrative with the supplementary annual reports, it is simply
this: CONFIDENCE IN GOD.

In a little sketch of Beate Paulus, the Frau Pastorin pleads with God in
a great crisis not to forsake her, quaintly adding that she was "willing
to be the second whom He might forsake," but she was "determined not to
be the first."* George Müller believed that, in all ages, there had
never yet been one true and trusting believer to whom God had proven
false or faithless, and he was perfectly sure that He could be safely
trusted who, "if we believe not, yet abideth faithful: He cannot deny
Himself."† God has not only spoken, but sworn; His word is
confirmed by His oath: because He could swear by no greater He sware by
Himself. And all this that we might have a strong consolation; that we
might have boldness in venturing upon Him, laying hold and holding fast
His promise. Unbelief makes God a liar and, worse still, a perjurer,
for it accounts Him as not only false to His word, but to His oath.
George Müller believed, and because he believed, prayed; and praying,
expected; and expecting, received. Blessed is he that believes, for
there shall be a performance of those things which are spoken of the
Lord.

IF much hangs and turns upon the choice of the work we are to do and
the field where we are to do it, it must not be forgotten how much
also depends on the time when it is undertaken, the way in which it
is performed, and the associates in the labour. In all these matters
the true workman will wait for the Master''s beck, glance, or signal,
before a step is taken.

We have come now to a new fork in the road where the path ahead begins
to be more plain. The future and permanent centre of his life-work is at
this point clearly indicated to God''s servant by divine leading.

In March, 1832, his friend Mr. Henry Craik left Shaldon for four weeks
of labour in Bristol, where Mr. Müller''s strong impression was that
the Lord had for Mr. Craik some more lasting sphere of work, though as
yet it had not dawned upon his mind that he himself was to be a
co-worker in that sphere, and to find in that very city the place of his
permanent abode and the centre of his life''s activities. God again led
the blind by a way he knew not. The conviction, however, had grown upon
him that the Lord was loosing him from Teignmouth, and, without having
in view any other definite field, he felt that his ministry there was
drawing to a close; and he inclined to go about again from place to
place, seeking especially to bring believers to a fuller trust in God
and a deeper sense of His faithfulness, and to a more thorough search
into His word. His inclination to such itinerant work was strengthened
by the fact that outside of Teignmouth his preaching both gave him much
more enjoyment and sense of power, and drew more hearers.

On April 13th a letter from Mr. Craik, inviting Mr. Müller to join in
his work at Bristol, made such an impression on his mind that he began
prayerfully to consider whether it was not God''s call, and whether a
field more suited to his gifts was not opening to him. The following
Lord''s day, preaching on the Lord''s coming, he referred to the effect of
this blessed hope in impelling God''s messenger to bear witness more
widely and from place to place, and reminded the brethren that he had
refused to bind himself to abide with them that he might at any moment
be free to follow the divine leading elsewhere.

On April 20th Mr. Müller left for Bristol. On the journey he was dumb,
having no liberty in speaking for Christ or even in giving away tracts,
and this led him to reflect. He saw that the so-called ''work of the
Lord'' had tempted him to substitute action for meditation and
communion. He had neglected that still hour'' with God which supplies to
spiritual life alike its breath and its bread. No lesson is more
important for us to learn, yet how slow are we to learn it: that for the
lack of habitual seasons set apart for devout meditation upon the word
of God and for prayer, nothing else will compensate.

We are prone to think, for example, that converse with Christian
brethren, and the general round of Christian activity, especially when
we are much busied with preaching the Word and visits to inquiring or
needy souls, make up for the loss of aloneness with God in the secret
place. We hurry to a public service with but a few minutes of private
prayer, allowing precious time to be absorbed in social pleasures,
restrained from withdrawing from others by a false delicacy, when to
excuse ourselves for needful communion with God and his word would have
been perhaps the best witness possible to those whose company was
holding us unduly! How often we rush from one public engagement to
another without any proper interval for renewing our strength in waiting
on the Lord, as though God cared more for the quantity than the quality
of our service!

Here Mr. Müller had the grace to detect one of the foremost perils of a
busy man in this day of insane hurry. He saw that if we are to feed
others we must be fed; and that even public and united exercises of
praise and prayer can never supply that food which is dealt out to the
believer only in the closet—the shut-in place with its closed door and
open window, where he meets God alone. In a previous chapter reference
has been made to the fact that three times in the word of God we find a
divine prescription for a true prosperity. God says to Joshua, "This
book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according
to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way
prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success" (Joshua i. 8.) Five
hundred years later the inspired author of the first Psalm repeats the
promise in unmistakable terms. The Spirit there says of him whose
delight is in the law of the Lord and who in His law doth meditate day
and night, that "he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." Here the devout
meditative student of the blessed book of God is likened to an evergreen
tree planted beside unfailing supplies of moisture; his fruit is
perennial, and so is his verdure—and whatsoever he doeth prospers!
More than a thousand years pass away, and, before the New Testament is
sealed up as complete, once more the Spirit bears essentially the same
blessed witness. "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and
continueth" (i.e. continueth looking—meditating on what he there
beholds, lest he forget the impression received through the mirror of
the Word), "this man shall be blessed in his deed" (James i. 25.)

Here then we have a threefold witness to the secret of true prosperity
and unmingled blessing: devout meditation and reflection upon the
Scriptures, which are at once a book of law, a river of life, and a
mirror of self—fitted to convey the will of God, the life of God, and
the transforming power of God. That believer makes a fatal mistake who
for any cause neglects the prayerful study of the word of God. To read
God''s holy book, by it search one''s self, and turn it into prayer and so
into holy living, is the one great secret of growth in grace and
godliness. The worker for God must first be a worker with God: he
must have power with God and must prevail with Him in prayer, if he is
to have power with men and prevail with men in preaching or in any form
of witnessing and serving. At all costs let us make sure of that highest
preparation for our work—the preparation of our own souls; and for this
we must take time to be alone with His word and His Spirit, that we
may truly meet God, and understand His will and the revelation of
Himself.

If we seek the secrets of the life George Müller lived and the work he
did, this is the very key to the whole mystery, and with that key any
believer can unlock the doors to a prosperous growth in grace and power
in service. God''s word is His WORD—the expression of His thought, the
revealing of His mind and heart. The supreme end of life is to know God
and make Him known; and how is this possible so long as we neglect the
very means He has chosen for conveying to us that knowledge! Even
Christ, the Living Word, is to be found enshrined in the written word.
Our knowledge of Christ is dependent upon our acquaintance with the Holy
Scriptures, which are the reflection of His character and glory—the
firmament across the expanse of which He moves as the Sun of
righteousness.

On April 22, 1832, George Müller first stood in the pulpit of Gideon
Chapel. The fact and the date are to be carefully marked as the new
turning-point in a career of great usefulness. Henceforth, for almost
exactly sixty-six years, Bristol is to be inseparably associated with
his name. Could he have foreseen, on that Lord''s day, what a work the
Lord would do through him in that city; how from it as a centre his
influence would radiate to the earth''s ends, and how, even after his
departure, he should continue to bear witness by the works which should
follow him, how his heart would have swelled and burst with holy
gratitude and praise,—while in humility he shrank back in awe and
wonder from a responsibility and an opportunity so vast and
overwhelming!

In the afternoon of this first Sabbath he preached at Pithay Chapel a
sermon conspicuously owned of God. Among others converted by it was a
young man, a notorious drunkard. And, before the sun had set, Mr.
Müller, who in the evening heard Mr. Craik preach, was fully persuaded
that the Lord had brought him to Bristol for a purpose, and that for a
while, at least, there he was to labour. Both he and his brother Craik
felt, however, that Bristol was not the place to reach a clear decision,
for the judgment was liable to be unduly biassed when subject to the
pressure of personal urgency, and so they determined to return to their
respective fields of previous labour, there to wait quietly upon the
Lord for the promised wisdom from above. They left for Devonshire on the
first of May; but already a brother had been led to assume the
responsibility for the rent of Bethesda Chapel as a place for their
joint labours, thus securing a second commodious building for public
worship.

Such blessing had rested on these nine days of united testimony in
Bristol that they both gathered that the Lord had assuredly called them
thither. The seal of His sanction had been on all they had undertaken,
and the last service at Gideon Chapel on April 29th had been so thronged
that many went away for lack of room.

Mr. Müller found opportunity for the exercise of humility, for he saw
that by many his brother''s gifts were much preferred to his own; yet, as
Mr. Craik would come to Bristol only with him as a yokefellow, God''s
grace enabled him to accept the humiliation of being the less popular,
and comforted him with the thought that two are better than one, and
that each might possibly fill up some lack in the other, and thus both
together prove a greater benefit and blessing alike to sinners and to
saints—as the result showed. That same grace of God helped Mr. Müller
to rise higher—nay, let us rather say, to sink lower and, "in honor
preferring one another," to rejoice rather than to be envious; and, like
John the Baptist, to say within himself: "A man can receive nothing
except it be given him from above." Such a humble spirit has even in
this life oftentimes its recompense of reward. Marked as was the impress
of Mr. Craik upon Bristol, Mr. Müller''s influence was even deeper and
wider. As Henry Craik died in 1866, his own work reached through a much
longer period; and as he was permitted to make such extensive mission
tours throughout the world, his witness was far more outreaching. The
lowly-minded man who bowed down to take the lower place, consenting to
be the more obscure, was by God exalted to the higher seat and greater
throne of influence.

Within a few weeks the Lord''s will, as to their new sphere, became so
plain to both these brethren that on May 23d Mr. Müller left Teignmouth
for Bristol, to be followed next day by Mr. Craik. At the believers''
meeting at Gideon Chapel they stated their terms, which were acceded to:
that they were to be regarded as accepting no fixed relationship to the
congregation, preaching in such manner and for such a season as should
seem to them according to the Lord''s will; that they should not be under
bondage to any rules among them; that pew-rents should be done away
with; and that they should, as in Devonshire, look to the Lord to
supply all temporal wants through the voluntary offerings of those to
whom they ministered.

Within a month Bethesda Chapel had been so engaged for a year as to risk
no debt, and on July 6th services began there as at Gideon. From the
very first, the Spirit set His seal on the joint work of these two
brethren. Ten days after the opening service at Bethesda, an evening
being set for inquirers, the throng of those seeking counsel was so
great that more than four hours were consumed in ministering to
individual souls, and so from time to time similar meetings were held
with like encouragement.

August 13, 1832, was a memorable day. On that evening at Bethesda Chapel
Mr. Müller, Mr. Craik, one other brother, and four sisters—only seven
in all—sat down together, uniting in church fellowship "without any
rules,—desiring to act only as the Lord should be pleased to give light
through His word."

This is a very short and simple entry in Mr. Mailer''s journal, but it
has most solemn significance. It records what was to him separation to
the hallowed work of building up a simple apostolic church, with no
manual of guidance but the New Testament; and in fact it introduces us
to the THIRD PERIOD of his life, when he entered fully upon the work to
which God had set him apart. The further steps now followed in rapid
succession. God having prepared the workman and gathered the material,
the structure went on quietly and rapidly until the life-work was
complete.

Cholera was at this time raging in Bristol. This terrible ''scourge of
God'' first appeared about the middle of July and continued for three
months, prayer-meetings being held often, and for a time daily, to plead
for the removal of this visitation. Death stalked abroad, the knell of
funeral-bells almost constantly sounding, and much solemnity hanging
like a dark pall over the community. Of course many visits to the sick,
dying, and afflicted became necessary, but it is remarkable that, among
all the children of God among whom Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik laboured,
but one died of this disease.

In the midst of all this gloom and sorrow of a fatal epidemic, a little
daughter was born to Mr. and Mrs. Müller September 17, 1832. About her
name, Lydia, sweet fragrance lingers, for she became one of God''s purest
saints and the beloved wife of James Wright. How little do we forecast
at the time the future of a new-born babe who, like Samuel, may in God''s
decree be established to be a prophet of the Lord, or be set apart to
some peculiar sphere of service, as in the case of another Lydia, whose
heart the Lord opened and whom He called to be the nucleus of the first
Christian church in Europe.

Mr. Müllers unfeigned humility, and the docility that always accompanies
that unconscious grace, found new exercise when the meetings with
inquirers revealed the fact that his colleague''s preaching was much more
used of God than his own, in conviction and conversion. This discovery
led to much self-searching, and he concluded that three reasons lay back
of this fact: first, Mr. Craik was more spiritually minded than himself;
second, he was more earnest in prayer for converting power; and third,
he oftener spoke directly to the unsaved, in his public ministrations.
Such disclosures of his own comparative lack did not exhaust themselves
in vain self-reproaches, but led at once to more importunate prayer,
more diligent preparation for addressing the unconverted, and more
frequent appeals to this class. From this time on, Mr. Müller''s
preaching had the seal of God upon it equally with his brother''s. What a
wholesome lesson to learn, that for every defect in our service there is
a cause, and that the one all-sufficient remedy is the throne of grace,
where in every time of need we may boldly come to find grace and help!
It has been already noted that Mr. Müller did not satisfy himself with
more prayer, but gave new diligence and study to the preparation of
discourses adapted to awaken careless souls. In the supernatural as well
as the natural sphere, there is a law of cause and effect. Even the
Spirit of God works not without order and method; He has His chosen
channels through which He pours blessing. There is no accident in the
spiritual world. "The Spirit bloweth where He listeth," but even the
wind has its circuits. There is a kind of preaching, fitted to bring
conviction and conversion, and there is another kind which is not so
fitted. Even in the faithful use of truth there is room for
discrimination and selection. In the armory of the word of God are many
weapons, and all have their various uses and adaptations. Blessed is the
workman or warrior who seeks to know what particular implement or
instrument God appoints for each particular work or conflict. We are to
study to keep in such communion with His word and Spirit as that we
shall be true workmen that need "not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
word of truth." (2 Tim. ii. 15.)

This expression, found in Paul''s second letter to Timothy, is a very
peculiar one
(ορθοτομουντα
τον λογον της
αληθειας). It
seems to be nearly equivalent to the Latin phrase recte viam secare—to
cut a straight road—and to hint that the true workman of God is like
the civil engineer to whom it is given to construct a direct road to a
certain point. The hearer''s heart and conscience is the objective point,
and the aim of the preacher should be, so to use God''s truth as to reach
most directly and effectively the needs of the hearer. He is to avoid
all circuitous routes, all evasions, all deceptive apologies and by-ways
of argument, and seek by God''s help to find the shortest, straightest,
quickest road to the convictions and resolutions of those to whom he
speaks. And if the road-builder, before he takes any other step, first
carefully surveys his territory and lays out his route, how much more
should the preacher first study the needs of his hearers and the best
ways of successfully dealing with them, and then with even more
carefulness and prayerfulness study the adaptation of the word of God
and the gospel message to meet those wants.

Early in the year 1833, letters from missionaries in Baghdad urged
Messrs. Müller and Craik to join them in labours in that distant field,
accompanying the invitation with drafts for two hundred pounds for costs
of travel. Two weeks of prayerful inquiry as to the mind of the Lord,
however, led them to a clear decision not to go—a choice never
regretted, and which is here recorded only as part of a complete
biography, and as illustrating the manner in which each new call for
service was weighed and decided.

We now reach another stage of Mr. Müller''s entrance upon his complete
life-work. In February, 1832, he had begun to read the biography of A.
H. Francke, the founder of the Orphan Houses of Halle. As that life and
work were undoubtedly used of God to make him a like instrument in a
kindred service, and to mould even the methods of his philanthropy, a
brief sketch of Francke''s career may be helpful.

August H. Francke was Müller''s fellow countryman. About 1696, at Halle
in Prussia, he had commenced the largest enterprise for poor children
then existing in the world. He trusted in God, and He whom he trusted
did not fail him, but helped him throughout abundantly.

The institutions, which resembled rather a large street than a building,
were erected, and in them about two thousand orphan children were
housed, fed, clad, and taught. For about thirty years all went on under
Francke''s own eyes, until 1727, when it pleased the Master to call the
servant up higher; and after his departure his like-minded son-in-law
became the director. Two hundred years have passed, and these Orphan
Houses are still in existence, serving their noble purpose.

It is needful only to look at these facts and compare with Francke''s
work in Halle George Müller''s monuments to a prayer-hearing God on
Ashley Down, to see that in the main the latter work so far resembles
the former as to be in not a few respects its counterpart. Mr. Müller
began his orphan work a little more than one hundred years after
Francke''s death; ultimately housed, fed, clothed, and taught over two
thousand orphans year by year; personally supervised the work for over
sixty years—twice as long a period as that of Francke''s personal
management—and at his decease likewise left his like minded son-in-law
to be his successor as the sole director of the work. It need not be
added that, beginning his enterprise like Francke in dependence on God
alone, the founder of the Bristol Orphan Houses trusted from first to
last only in Him.

It is very noticeable how, when God is preparing a workman for a certain
definite service, He often leads him out of the beaten track into a path
peculiarly His own by means of some striking biography, or by contact
with some other living servant who is doing some such work, and
exhibiting the spirit which must guide if there is to be a true success.
Meditation on Franeke''s life and work naturally led this man who was
hungering for a wider usefulness to think more of the poor homeless
waifs about him, and to ask whether he also could not plan under God
some way to provide for them; and as he was musing the fire burned.

As early as June 12, 1833, when not yet twenty-eight years old, the
inward flame began to find vent in a scheme which proved the first
forward step toward his orphan work. It occurred to him to gather out of
the streets, at about eight o''clock each morning, the poor children,
give them a bit of bread for breakfast, and then, for about an hour and
a half, teach them to read or read to them the Holy Scriptures; and
later on to do a like service to the adult and aged poor. He began at
once to feed from thirty to forty such persons, confident that, as the
number increased, the Lord''s provision would increase also. Unburdening
his heart to Mr. Craik, he was guided to a place which could hold one
hundred and fifty children and which could be rented for ten shillings
yearly; as also to an aged brother who would gladly undertake the
teaching.

Unexpected obstacles, however, prevented the carrying out of this plan.
The work already pressing upon Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik, the rapid
increase of applicants for food, and the annoyance to neighbours of
having crowds of idlers congregating in the streets and lying about in
troops—these were some of the reasons why this method was abandoned.
But the central thought and aim were never lost sight of: God had
planted a seed in the soil of Mr. Müllers heart, presently to spring up
in the orphan work, and in the Scriptural Knowledge Institution with its
many branches and far-reaching fruits.

From time to time a backward glance over the Lord''s dealings encouraged
his heart, as he looked forward to unknown paths and untried scenes. He
records at this time—the close of the year 1833—that during the four
years since he first began to trust in the Lord alone for temporal
supplies he had suffered no want. He had received during the first year
one hundred and thirty pounds, during the second one hundred and
fifty-one, during the third one hundred and ninety-five, and during the
last two hundred and sixty-seven—all in free-will offerings and without
ever asking any human being for a penny. He had looked alone to the
Lord, yet he had not only received a supply, but an increasing supply,
year by year. Yet he also noticed that at each year''s close he had very
little, if anything, left, and that much had come through strange
channels, from distances very remote, and from parties whom he had never
seen. He observed also that in every case, according as the need was
greater or less, the supply corresponded. He carefully records for the
benefit of others that, when the calls for help were many, the Great
Provider showed Himself able and willing to send help accordingly.* The
ways of divine dealing which he had thus found true of the early years
of his life of trust were marked and magnified in all his
after-experience, and the lessons learned in these first four years
prepared him for others taught in the same school of God and under the
same Teacher.

Thus God had brought His servant by a way which he knew not to the very
place and sphere of his life''s widest and most enduring work. He had
moulded and shaped His chosen vessel, and we are now to see to what
purposes of world-wide usefulness that earthen vessel was to be put, and
how conspicuously the excellency of the power was to be of God and not
of man.

THE time was now fully come when the divine Husbandman was to glorify
Himself by a product of His own husbandry in the soil of Bristol.

On February 20, 1834, George Müller was led of God to sow the seed of
what ultimately developed into a great means of good, known as "The
Scriptural Knowledge Institution, for Home and Abroad." As in all other
steps of his life, this was the result of much prayer, meditation on the
Word, searching of his own heart, and patient waiting to know the mind
of God.

A brief statement of the reasons for founding such an institution, and
the principles on which it was based, will be helpful at this point.
Motives of conscience controlled Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik in starting a
new work rather than in uniting with existing societies already
established for missionary purposes, Bible and tract distribution, and
for the promotion of Christian schools. As they had sought to conform
personal life and church conduct wholly to the scriptural pattern, they
felt that all work for God should be carefully carried on in exact
accordance with His known will, in order to have His fullest blessing.
Many features of the existing societies seemed to them extra-scriptural,
if not decidedly anti-scriptural, and these they felt constrained to
avoid.

For example, they felt that the end proposed by such organizations,
namely, the conversion of the world in this dispensation, was not
justified by the Word, which everywhere represents this as the age of
the outgathering of the church from the world, and not the
ingathering of the world into the church. To set such an end before
themselves as the world''s conversion would therefore not only be
unwarranted by Scripture, but delusive and disappointing, disheartening
God''s servants by the failure to realize the result, and dishonoring to
God Himself by making Him to appear unfaithful.

Again, these existing societies seemed to Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik to
sustain a wrong relation to the world—mixed up with it, instead of
separate from it. Any one by paying a certain fixed sum of money might
become a member or even a director, having a voice or vote in the
conduct of affairs and becoming eligible to office. Unscriptural means
were commonly used to raise money, such as appealing for aid to
unconverted persons, asking for donations simply for money''s sake and
without regard to the character of the donors or the manner in which the
money was obtained. The custom of seeking patronage from men of the
world and asking such to preside at public meetings, and the habit of
contracting debts,—these and some other methods of management seemed
so unscriptural and unspiritual that the founders of this new
institution could not with a good conscience give them sanction. Hence
they hoped that by basing their work upon thoroughly biblical principles
they might secure many blessed results.

First of all, they confidently believed that the work of the Lord could
be best and most successfully carried on within the landmarks and limits
set up in His word; that the fact of thus carrying it on would give
boldness in prayer and confidence in labour. But they also desired the
work itself to be a witness to the living God, and a testimony to
believers, by calling attention to the objectionable methods already in
use and encouraging all God''s true servants in adhering to the
principles and practices which He has sanctioned.

On March 5th at a public meeting a formal announcement of the intention
to found such an institution was accompanied by a full statement of its
purposes and principles,* in substance as follows:

3. Pecuniary aid, or help in managing or carrying on its affairs, is not
to be asked for or sought from those who are not believers.

Thus the word of God was accepted as counsellor, and all dependence was
on God''s blessing in answer to prayer.

1. To establish or aid day-schools, Sunday-schools, and adult-schools,
taught and conducted only by believers and on thoroughly scriptural
principles.

3. To aid missionary efforts and assist labourers, in the Lord''s
vineyard anywhere, who are working upon a biblical basis and looking
only to the Lord for support.

To project such a work, on such a scale, and at such a time, was doubly
an act of faith; for not only was the work already in hand enough to tax
all available time and strength, but at this very time this record
appears in Mr. Müller''s journal: "We have only one shilling left."
Surely no advance step would have been taken, had not the eyes been
turned, not on the empty purse, but on the full and exhaustless treasury
of a rich and bountiful Lord!

It was plainly God''s purpose that, out of such abundance of poverty, the
riches of His liberality should be manifested. It pleased Him, from whom
and by whom are all things, that the work should be begun when His
servants were poorest and weakest, that its growth to such giant
proportions might the more prove it to be a plant of His own right
hand''s planting, and that His word might be fulfilled in its whole
history:

"I the Lord do keep it:
        I will water it every moment:
        Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day:"
            (Isa. xxvii. 3.)

Whatever may be thought as to the need of such a new organization, or as
to such scruples as moved its founders to insist even in minor matters
upon the closest adherence to scripture teaching, this at least is
plain, that for more than half a century it has stood upon its original
foundation, and its increase and usefulness have surpassed the most
enthusiastic dreams of its founders; nor have the principles first
avowed ever been abandoned. With the Living God as its sole patron, and
prayer as its only appeal, it has attained vast proportions, and its
world-wide work has been signally owned and blessed.

On March 19th Mrs. Müller gave birth to a son, to the great joy of his
parents; and, after much prayer, they gave him the name Elijah—"My God
is Jah"—the name itself being one of George Müllers life-mottoes. Up to
this time the families of Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik had dwelt under one
roof, but henceforth it was thought wise that they should have separate
lodgings.

When, at the close of 1834, the usual backward glance was cast over the
Lord''s leadings and dealings, Mr. Müller gratefully recognized the
divine goodness which had thus helped him to start upon its career the
work with its several departments. Looking to the Lord alone for light
and help, he had laid the corner-stone of this "little institution"; and
in October, after only seven months'' existence, it had already begun to
be established. In the Sunday-school there were one hundred and twenty
children; in the adult classes, forty; in the four day-schools, two
hundred and nine boys and girls; four hundred and eighty-two Bibles and
five hundred and twenty Testaments had been put into circulation, and
fifty-seven pounds had been spent in aid of missionary operations.
During these seven months the Lord had sent, in answer to prayer, over
one hundred and sixty-seven pounds in money, and much blessing upon the
work itself. The brothers and sisters who were in charge had likewise
been given by the same prayer-hearing God, in direct response to the cry
of need and the supplication of faith.

Meanwhile another object was coming into greater prominence before the
mind and heart of Mr. Müller: it was the thought of making some
permanent provision for fatherless and motherless children.

An orphan boy who had been in the school had been taken to the
poorhouse, no longer able to attend on account of extreme poverty; and
this little incident set Mr. Müller thinking and praying about orphans.
Could not something be done to meet the temporal and spiritual wants of
this class of very poor children? Unconsciously to himself, God had set
a seed in his soul, and was watching and watering it. The idea of a
definite orphan work had taken root within him, and, like any other
living germ, it was springing up and growing, he knew not how. As yet it
was only in the blade, but in time there would come the ear and the
full-grown corn in the ear, the new seed of a larger harvest.

Meanwhile the church was growing. In these two and a half years over two
hundred had been added, making the total membership two hundred and
fifty-seven; but the enlargement of the work generally neither caused
the church life to be neglected nor any one department of duty to suffer
declension—a very noticeable fact in this history.

The point to which we have now come is one of double interest and
importance, as at once a point of arrival and of departure. The work of
God''s chosen servant may be considered as fairly if not fully
inaugurated in all its main forms of service. He himself is in his
thirtieth year, the age when his divine Master began to be fully
manifest to the world and to go about doing good. Through the
preparatory steps and stages leading up to his complete mission and
ministry to the church and the world, Christ''s humble disciple has
likewise been brought, and his fuller career of usefulness now begins,
with the various agencies in operation whereby for more than threescore
years he was to show both proof and example of what God can do through
one man who is willing to be simply the instrument for Him to work with.
Nothing is more marked in George Müller, to the very day of his death,
than this, that he so looked to God and leaned on God that he felt
himself to be nothing, and God everything. He sought to be always and in
all things surrendered as a passive tool to the will and hand of the
Master Workman.

This point of arrival and of departure is also a point of prospect.
Here, halting and looking backward, we may take in at a glance the
various successive steps and stages of preparation whereby the Lord had
made His servant ready for the sphere of service to which He called, and
for which He fitted him. One has only, from this height, to look over
the ten years that were past, to see beyond dispute or doubt the divine
design that lay back of George Müllers life, and to feel an awe of the
God who thus chooses and shapes, and then uses, His vessels of service.

It will be well, even if it involves some repetition, to pass in review
the more important steps in the process by which the divine Potter had
shaped His vessel for His purpose, educating and preparing George Müller
for His work.

1. First of all, his conversion. In the most unforeseen manner and at
the most unexpected time God led him to turn from the error of his way,
and brought him to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.

2. Next, his missionary spirit. That consuming flame was kindled
within him which, when it is fanned by the Spirit and fed by the fuel of
facts, inclines to unselfish service and makes one willing to go
wherever, and to do whatever, the Lord will.

3. Next, his renunciation of self. In more than one instance he was
enabled to give up for Christ''s sake an earthly attachment that was
idolatrous, because it was a hindrance to his full obedience and
single-eyed loyalty to his heavenly Master.

4. Then his taking counsel of God. Early in his Christian life he
formed the habit, in things great and small, of ascertaining the will of
the Lord before taking action, asking guidance in every matter, through
the Word and the Spirit.

5. His humble and childlike temper. The Father drew His child to
Himself, imparting to him the simple mind that asks believingly and
trusts confidently, and the filial spirit that submits to fatherly
counsel and guidance.

6. His method of preaching. Under this same divine tuition he early
learned how to preach the Word, in simple dependence on the Spirit of
God, studying the Scriptures in the original and expounding them without
wisdom of words.

7. His cutting loose from man. Step by step, all dependence on man or
appeals to man for pecuniary support were abandoned, together with all
borrowing, running into debt, stated salary, etc. His eyes were turned
to God alone as the Provider.

8. His satisfaction in the Word. As knowledge of the Scriptures grew,
love for the divine oracles increased, until all other books, even of a
religious sort, lost their charms in comparison with God''s own
text-book, as explained and illumined by the divine Interpreter.

9. His thorough Bible study. Few young men have ever been led to such
a systematic search into the treasures of God''s truth. He read the Book
of God through and through, fixing its teachings on his mind by
meditation and translating them into practice.

10. His freedom from human control. He felt the need of independence
of man in order to complete dependence on God, and boldly broke all
fetters that hindered his liberty in preaching, in teaching, or in
following the heavenly Guide and serving the heavenly Master.

11. His use of opportunity. He felt the value of souls, and he formed
habits of approaching others as to matters of salvation, even in public
conveyances. By a word of witness, a tract, a humble example, he sought
constantly to lead some one to Christ.

12. His release from civil obligations. This was purely providential.
In a strange way God set him free from all liability to military
service, and left him free to pursue his heavenly calling as His
soldier, without entanglement in the affairs of this life.

13. His companions in service. Two most efficient coworkers were
divinely provided: first his brother Craik so like-minded with himself,
and secondly, his wife, so peculiarly God''s gift, both of them proving
great aids in working and in bearing burdens of responsibility.

14. His view of the Lord''s coming. He thanked God for unveiling to him
that great truth, considered by him as second to no other in its
influence upon his piety and usefulness; and in the light of it he saw
clearly the purpose of this gospel age, to be not to convert the world
but to call out from it a believing church as Christ''s bride.

15. His waiting on God for a message. For every new occasion he asked
of Him a word in season; then a mode of treatment, and unction in
delivery; and, in godly simplicity and sincerity, with the demonstration
of the Spirit, he aimed to reach the hearers.

16. His submission to the authority of the Word. In the light of the
holy oracles he reviewed all customs, however ancient, and all
traditions of men, however popular, submitted all opinions and practices
to the test of Scripture, and then, regardless of consequences, walked
according to any new light God gave him.

17. His pattern of church life. From his first entrance upon pastoral
work, he sought to lead others only by himself following the Shepherd
and Bishop of Souls. He urged the assembly of believers to conform in
all things to New Testament models so far as they could be clearly found
in the Word, and thus reform all existing abuses.

18. His stress upon voluntary offerings. While he courageously gave up
all fixed salary for himself, he taught that all the work of God should
be maintained by the freewill gifts of believers, and that pew-rents
promote invidious distinctions among saints.

19. His surrender of all earthly possessions. Both himself and his
wife literally sold all they had and gave alms, henceforth to live by
the day, hoarding no money even against a time of future need, sickness,
old age, or any other possible crisis of want.

20. His habit of secret prayer. He learned so to prize closet
communion with God that he came to regard it as his highest duty and
privilege. To him nothing could compensate for the lack or loss of that
fellowship with God and meditation on His word which are the support of
all spiritual life.

21. His jealousy of his testimony. In taking oversight of a
congregation he took care to guard himself from all possible
interference with fulness and freedom of utterance and of service. He
could not brook any restraints upon his speech or action that might
compromise his allegiance to the Lord or his fidelity to man.

22. His organizing of work. God led him to project a plan embracing
several departments of holy activity, such as the spreading of the
knowledge of the word of God everywhere, and the encouraging of
world-wide evangelization and the Christian education of the young; and
to guard the new Institution from all dependence on worldly patronage,
methods, or appeals.

23. His sympathy with orphans. His loving heart had been drawn out
toward poverty and misery everywhere, but especially in the case of
destitute children bereft of both parents; and familiarity with
Francke''s work at Halle suggested similar work at Bristol.

24. Beside all these steps of preparation, he had been guided by the
Lord from his birthplace in Prussia to London, Teignmouth, and Bristol
in Britain, and thus the chosen vessel, shaped for its great use, had by
the same divine Hand been borne to the very place where it was to be of
such signal service in testimony to the Living God.

Surely no candid observer can survey this course of divine discipline
and preparation, and remember how brief was the period of time it
covers, being less than ten years, and mark the many distinct steps by
which this education for a life of service was made singularly complete,
without a feeling of wonder and awe. Every prominent feature, afterward
to appear conspicuous in the career of this servant of God, was
anticipated in the training whereby he was fitted for his work and
introduced to it. We have had a vivid vision of the divine Potter
sitting at His wheel, taking the clay in His hands, softening its
hardness, subduing it to His own will; then gradually and skilfully
shaping from it the earthen vessel; then baking it in His oven of
discipline till it attained the requisite solidity and firmness, then
filling it with the rich treasures of His word and Spirit, and finally
setting it down where He would have it serve His special uses in
conveying to others the excellency of His power!

To lose sight of this sovereign shaping Hand is to miss one of the main
lessons God means to teach us by George Müller''s whole career. He
himself saw and felt that he was only an earthen vessel; that God had
both chosen and filled him for the work he was to do; and, while this
conviction made him happy in his work, it made him humble, and the older
he grew the humbler he became. He felt more and more his own utter
insufficiency. It grieved him that human eyes should ever turn away from
the Master to the servant, and he perpetually sought to avert their gaze
from himself to God alone. "For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are
all things—to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."

There are several important episodes in Mr. Müller''s history which may
be lightly passed by, because not so characteristic of him as that they
might not have been common to many others, and therefore not
constituting features so distinguishing this life from others as to make
it a special lesson to believers.

For example, early in 1835 he made a visit to Germany upon a particular
errand. He went to aid Mr. Groves, who had come from the East Indies to
get missionary recruits, and who asked help of him, as of one knowing
the language of the country, in setting the claims of India before
German brethren, and pleading for its unsaved millions.

When Mr. Müller went to the alien office in London to get a passport, he
found that, through ignorance, he had broken the law which required
every alien semi-annually to renew his certificate of residence, under
penalty of fifty pounds fine or imprisonment. He confessed to the
officer his non-compliance, excusing himself only on the ground of
ignorance, and trusted all consequences with God, who graciously
inclined the officer to pass over his non-compliance with the law.
Another hindrance which still interfered with obtaining his passport,
was also removed in answer to prayer; so that at the outset he was much
impressed with the Lord''s sanction of his undertaking.

His sojourn abroad continued for nearly two months, during which time he
was at Paris, Strasburg, Basle, Tubingen, Wurtemberg, Sehaffhausen,
Stuttgart, Halle, Sandersleben, Aschersleben, Heimersleben, Halberstadt,
and Hamburg. At Halle, calling on Dr. Tholuck after seven years of
separation, he was warmly welcomed and constrained to lodge at his
house. From Dr. Tholuck he heard many delightful incidents as to former
fellow students who had been turned to the Lord from impious paths, or
had been strengthened in their Christian faith and devotion. He also
visited Francke''s orphan houses, spending an evening in the very room
where God''s work of grace had begun in his heart, and meeting again
several of the same little company of believers that in those days had
prayed together.

He likewise gave everywhere faithful witness to the Lord. While at his
father''s house the way was opened for him to bear testimony indirectly
to his father and brother. He had found that a direct approach to his
father upon the subject of his soul''s salvation only aroused his anger,
and he therefore judged that it was wiser to refrain from a course which
would only repel one whom he desired to win. An unconverted friend of
his father was visiting him at this time, before whom he put the truth
very frankly and fully, in the presence of both his father and brother,
and thus quite as effectively gave witness to them also. But he was
especially moved to pray that he might by his whole life bear witness at
his home, manifesting his love for his kindred and his own joy in God,
his satisfaction in Christ, and his utter indifference to all former
fascinations of a worldly and sinful life, through the supreme
attraction he found in Him; for this, he felt sure, would have far more
influence than any mere words: our walk counts for more than our talk,
always.

The effect was most happy. God so helped the son to live before the
father that, just before his leaving for England, he said to him: "My
son, may God help me to follow your example, and to act according to
what you have said to me!"

On June 22, 1835, Mr. Müller''s father-in-law, Mr. Groves, died; and both
of his own children were very ill, and four days later little Elijah was
taken. Both parents had been singularly prepared for these bereavements,
and were divinely upheld. They had felt no liberty in prayer for the
child''s recovery, dear as he was; and grandfather and grandson were laid
in one grave. Henceforth Mr. and Mrs. Müller were to have no son, and
Lydia was to remain their one and only child.

About the middle of the following month, Mr. Müller was quite disabled
from work by weakness of the chest, which made necessary rest and
change. The Lord tenderly provided for his need through those whose
hearts He touched, leading them to offer him and his wife hospitalities
in the Isle of Wight, while at the same time money was sent him which
was designated for ''a change of air.'' On his thirtieth birthday, in
connection with specially refreshing communion with God, and for the
first time since his illness, there was given him a spirit of believing
prayer for his own recovery; and his strength so rapidly grew that by
the middle of October he was back in Bristol.

It was just before this, on the ninth of the same month, that the
reading of John Newton''s Life stirred him up to bear a similar witness
to the Lord''s dealings with himself. Truly there are no little things
in our life, since what seems to be trivial may be the means of bringing
about results of great consequence. This is the second time that a
chance reading of a book had proved a turning-point with George Müller.
Franke''s life stirred his heart to begin an orphan work, and Newton''s
life suggested the narrative of the Lord''s dealings. To what is called
an accident are owing, under God, those pages of his life-journal which
read like new chapters in the Acts of the Apostles, and will yet be so
widely read, and so largely used of God.

THE last great step of full entrance upon Mr. Müller''s life-service was
the founding of the orphan work, a step so important and so prominent
that even the lesser particulars leading to it have a strange
significance and fascination.

In the year 1835, on November 20th, in taking tea at the house of a
Christian sister, he again saw a copy of Francke''s life. For no little
time he had thought of like labours, though on no such scale, nor in
mere imitation of Francke, but under a sense of similar divine leading.
This impression had grown into a conviction, and the conviction had
blossomed into a resolution which now rapidly ripened into corresponding
action. He was emboldened to take this forward step in sole reliance on
God, by the fact that at that very time, in answer to prayer, ten pounds
more had been sent him than he had asked for other existing work, as
though God gave him a token of both willingness and readiness to supply
all needs.

Nothing is more worthy of imitation, perhaps, than the uniformly
deliberate, self-searching, and prayerful way in which he set about any
work which he felt led to undertake. It was preeminently so in
attempting this new form of service, the future growth of which was not
then even in his thought. In daily prayer he sought as in his Master''s
presence to sift from the pure grain of a godly purpose to glorify Him,
all the chaff of selfish and carnal motives, to get rid of every taint
of worldly self-seeking or lust of applause, and to bring every thought
into captivity to the Lord. He constantly probed his own heart to
discover the secret and subtle impulses which are unworthy of a true
servant of God; and, believing that a spiritually minded brother often
helps one to an insight into his own heart, he spoke often to his
brother Craik about his plans, praying God to use him as a means of
exposing any unworthy motive, or of suggesting any scriptural objections
to his project. His honest aim being to please God, he yearned to know
his own heart, and welcomed any light which revealed his real self and
prevented a mistake.

Mr. Craik so decidedly encouraged him, and further prayer so confirmed
previous impressions of God''s guidance, that on December 2, 1835, the
first formal step was taken in ordering printed bills announcing a
public meeting for the week following, when the proposal to open an
orphan house was to be laid before brethren, and further light to be
sought unitedly as to the mind of the Lord.

Three days later, in reading the Psalms, he was struck with these nine
words:
        "OPEN THY MOUTH WIDE,
        AND I WILL FILL IT." (Psalm lxxxi. 10.)

From that moment this text formed one of his great life-mottoes, and
this promise became a power in moulding all his work. Hitherto he had
not prayed for the supply of money or of helpers, but he was now led to
apply this scripture confidently to this new plan, and at once boldly to
ask for premises, and for one thousand pounds in money, and for
suitable helpers to take charge of the children. Two days after, he
received, in furtherance of his work, the first gift of money—one
shilling—and within two days more the first donation in furniture—a
large wardrobe.

The day came for the memorable public meeting—December 9th. During the
interval Satan had been busy hurling at Mr. Müller his fiery darts, and
he was very low in spirit. He was taking a step not to be retraced
without both much humiliation to himself and reproach to his Master: and
what if it were a misstep and he were moving without real guidance
from above! But as soon as he began to speak, help was given him. He was
borne up on the Everlasting Arms, and had the assurance that the work
was of the Lord. He cautiously avoided all appeals to the transient
feelings of his hearers, and took no collection, desiring all these
first steps to be calmly taken, and every matter carefully and
prayerfully weighed before a decision. Excitement of emotion or
kindlings of enthusiasm might obscure the vision and hinder clear
apprehension of the mind of God. After the meeting there was a voluntary
gift of ten shillings, and one sister offered herself for the work. The
next morning a statement concerning the new orphan work was put in
print, and on January 16, 1836, a supplementary statement appeared.*

At every critical point Mr. Müller is entitled to explain his own views
and actions; and the work he was now undertaking is so vitally linked
with his whole after-life that it should here have full mention. As to
his proposed orphan house he gives three chief reasons for its
establishment:

1. That God may be glorified in so furnishing the means as to show that
it is not a vain thing to trust in Him.

He had frequent reminders in his pastoral labours that the faith of
God''s children greatly needed strengthening; and he longed to have some
visible proof to point to, that the heavenly Father is the same faithful
Promiser and Provider as ever, and as willing to PROVE Himself the
LIVING GOD to all who put their trust in Him, and that even in their
old age He does not forsake those who rely only upon Him. Remembering
the great blessing that had come to himself through the work of faith of
Francke, he judged that he was bound to serve the Church of Christ in
being able to take God at His word and rely upon it.

If he, a poor man, without asking any one but God, could get means to
carry on an orphan house, it would be seen that God is FAITHFUL STILL
and STILL HEARS PRAYER. While the orphan work was to be a branch of the
Scriptural Knowledge Institution, only those funds were to be applied
thereto which should be expressly given for that purpose; and it would
be carried on only so far and so fast as the Lord should provide both
money and helpers.

It was proposed to receive only such children as had been bereft of both
parents, and to take in such from their seventh to their twelfth year,
though later on younger orphans were admitted; and to bring up the boys
for a trade, and the girls for service, and to give them all a plain
education likely to fit them for their life-work.

So soon as the enterprise was fairly launched, the Lord''s power and will
to provide began at once and increasingly to appear; and, from this
point on, the journal is one long record of man''s faith and supplication
and of God''s faithfulness and interposition. It only remains to note the
new steps in advance which mark the growth of the work, and the new
straits which arise and how they are met, together with such questions
and perplexing crises as from time to time demand and receive a new
divine solution.

A foremost need was that of able and suitable helpers, which only God
could supply. In order fully to carry out his plans, Mr. Müller felt
that he must have men and women like-minded, who would naturally care
for the state of the orphans and of the work. If one Achan could disturb
the whole camp of Israel, and one Ananias or Saphira, the whole church
of Christ, one faithless, prayerless, self-seeking assistant would prove
not a helper but a hinderer both to the work itself and to all
fellow-workers. No step was therefore hastily taken. He had patiently
waited on God hitherto, and he now waited to receive at His hands His
own chosen servants to join in this service and give to it unity of plan
and spirit.

Before he called, the Lord answered. As early as December 10th a brother
and sister had willingly offered themselves, and the spirit that moved
them will appear in the language of their letter:

"We propose ourselves for the service of the intended orphan house, if
you think us qualified for it; also to give up all the furniture, etc.,
which the Lord has given us, for its use; and to do this without
receiving any salary whatever; believing that, if it be the will of the
Lord to employ us, He will supply all our need."

Other similar self-giving followed, proving that God''s people are
willing in the day of His power. He who wrought in His servant to will
and to work, sent helpers to share his burdens, and to this day has met
all similar needs out of His riches in glory. There has never yet been
any lack of competent, cheerful, and devoted helpers, although the work
so rapidly expanded and extended.

The gifts whereby the work was supported need a separate review that
many lessons of interest may find a record. But it should here be noted
that, among the first givers, was a poor needlewoman who brought the
surprising sum of one hundred pounds, the singular self-denial and
whole-hearted giving exhibited making this a peculiarly sacred offering
and a token of God''s favour. There was a felt significance in His choice
of a poor sickly seamstress as His instrument for laying the foundations
for this great work. He who worketh all things after the counsel of His
own will, passing by the rich, mighty, and noble somethings of this
world, chose again the poor, weak, base, despised nothings, that no
flesh should glory in His presence.

For work among orphans a house was needful, and for this definite prayer
was offered; and April 1, 1836, was fixed as the date for opening such
house for female orphans, as the most helplessly destitute. The
building, No. 6 Wilson Street, where Mr. Müller had himself lived up to
March 25th, having been rented for one year, was formally opened April
21st, the day being set apart for prayer and praise. The public
generally were informed that the way was open to receive needy
applicants, and the intimation was further made on May 18th that it was
intended shortly to open a second house for infant children—both boys
and girls.

We now retrace our steps a little to take special notice of a fact in
Mr. Müller''s experience which, in point of time, belongs earlier.

Though he had brought before the Lord even the most minute details about
his plans for the proposed orphan work and house and helpers, asking in
faith for building and furnishing, money for rent and other expenses,
etc., he confesses that he had never once asked the Lord to send the
orphans! This seems an unaccountable omission; but the fact is he had
assumed that there would be applications in abundance. His surprise and
chagrin cannot easily be imagined, when the appointed time came for
receiving applications, February 3rd, and not one application was
made! Everything was ready except the orphans. This led to the
deepest humiliation before God. All the evening of that day he literally
lay on his face, probing his own heart to read his own motives, and
praying God to search him and show him His mind. He was thus brought so
low that from his heart he could say that, if God would thereby be more
glorified, he would rejoice in the fact that his whole scheme should
come to nothing. The very next day the first application was made for
admission; on April 11th orphans began to be admitted; and by May 18th
there were in the house twenty-six, and more daily expected. Several
applications being made for children under seven, the conclusion was
reached that, while vacancies were left, the limit of years at first
fixed should not be adhered to; but every new step was taken with care
and prayer, that it should not be in the energy of the flesh, or in the
wisdom of man, but in the power and wisdom of the Spirit. How often we
forget that solemn warning of the Holy Ghost, that even when our whole
work is not imperilled by a false beginning, but is well laid upon a
true foundation, we may carelessly build into it wood, hay, and stubble,
which will be burned up in the fiery ordeal that is to try every man''s
work of what sort it is!

The first house had scarcely been opened for girls when the way for the
second was made plain, suitable premises being obtained at No. 1 in the
same street, and a well-fitted matron being given in answer to prayer.
On November 28th, some seven months after the opening of the first, this
second house was opened. Some of the older and abler girls from the
first house were used for the domestic work of the second, partly to
save hired help, and partly to accustom them to working for others and
thus give a proper dignity to what is sometimes despised as a degrading
and menial form of service. By April 8, 1837, there were in each house
thirty orphan children.

The founder of this orphan work, who had at the first asked for one
thousand pounds of God, tells us that, in his own mind, the thing was
as good as done, so that he often gave thanks for this large sum as
though already in hand. (Mark xi. 24; 1 John v. 13, 14.) This habit of
counting a promise as fulfilled had much to do with the triumphs of his
faith and the success of his labour. Now that the first part of his
Narrative of the Lord''s Dealings was about to issue from the press, he
felt that it would much honour the Master whom he served if the entire
amount should be actually in hand before the Narrative should appear,
and without any one having been asked to contribute. He therefore gave
himself anew to prayer; and on June 15th the whole sum was complete, no
appeal having been made but to the Living God, before whom, as he
records with his usual mathematical precision, he had daily brought his
petition for eighteen months and ten days.

In closing this portion of his narrative he hints at a proposed further
enlargement of the work in a third house for orphan boys above seven
years, with accommodations for about forty. Difficulties interposed, but
as usual disappeared before the power of prayer. Meanwhile the whole
work of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution prospered, four day-schools
having been established, with over one thousand pupils, and more than
four thousand copies of the word of God having been distributed.

George Müller was careful always to consult and then to obey conviction.
Hence his moral sense, by healthy exercise, more and more clearly
discerned good and evil. This conscientiousness was seen in the issue of
the first edition of his Narrative. When the first five hundred copies
came from the publishers, he was so weighed down by misgivings that he
hesitated to distribute them. Notwithstanding the spirit of prayer with
which he had begun, continued, and ended the writing of it and had made
every correction in the proof; notwithstanding the motive, consciously
cherished throughout, that God''s glory might be promoted in this record
of His faithfulness, he reopened with himself the whole question whether
this published Narrative might not turn the eyes of men from the great
Master Workman to His human instrument. As he opened the box containing
the reports, he felt strongly tempted to withhold from circulation the
pamphlets it held; but from the moment when he gave out the first copy,
and the step could not be retraced, his scruples were silenced.

He afterward saw his doubts and misgivings to have been a temptation of
Satan, and never thenceforth questioned that in writing, printing, and
distributing this and the subsequent parts of the Narrative he had done
the will of God. So broad and clear was the divine seal set upon it in
the large blessing it brought to many and widely scattered persons that
no room was left for doubt. It may be questioned whether any like
journal has been as widely read and as remarkably used, both in
converting sinners and in quickening saints. Proofs of this will
hereafter abundantly appear.

It was in the year 1837 that Mr. Müller, then in his thirty-second year,
felt with increasingly deep conviction that to his own growth in grace,
godliness, and power for service two things were quite indispensable:
first, more retirement for secret communion with God, even at the
apparent expense of his public work; and second, ampler provision for
the spiritual oversight of the flock of God, the total number of
communicants now being near to four hundred.

The former of these convictions has an emphasis which touches every
believer''s life at its vital centre. George Müller was conscious of
being too busy to pray as he ought. His outward action was too constant
for inward reflection, and he saw that there was risk of losing peace
and power, and that activity even in the most sacred sphere must not be
so absorbing as to prevent holy meditation on the Word and fervent
supplication. The Lord said first to Elijah, "Go, HIDE THYSELF"; then,
"Go, SHOW THYSELF." He who does not first hide himself in the secret
place to be alone with God, is unfit to show himself in the public place
to move among men. Mr. Müller afterward used to say to brethren who had
"too much to do" to spend proper time with God, that four hours of work
for which one hour of prayer prepares, is better than five hours of work
with the praying left out; that our service to our Master is more
acceptable and our mission to man more profitable, when saturated with
the moisture of God''s blessing—the dew of the Spirit. Whatever is
gained in quantity is lost in quality whenever one engagement follows
another without leaving proper intervals for refreshment and renewal of
strength by waiting on God. No man, perhaps, since John Wesley has
accomplished so much even in a long life as George Müller; yet few have
ever withdrawn so often or so long into the pavilion of prayer. In fact,
from one point of view his life seems more given to supplication and
intercession than to mere action or occupation among men.

At the same time he felt that the curacy of souls must not be neglected
by reason of his absorption in either work or prayer. Both believers and
inquirers needed pastoral oversight; neither himself nor his brother
Craik had time enough for visiting so large a flock, many of whom were
scattered over the city; and about fifty new members were added every
year who had special need of teaching and care. Again, as there were two
separate congregations, the number of meetings was almost doubled; and
the interruptions of visitors from near and far, the burdens of
correspondence, and the oversight of the Lord''s work generally, consumed
so much time that even with two pastors the needs of the church could
not be met. At a meeting of both congregations in October, these matters
were frankly brought before the believers, and it was made plain that
other helpers should be provided, and the two churches so united as to
lessen the number of separate meetings.

In October, 1837, a building was secured for a third orphan house, for
boys; but as the neighbours strongly opposed its use as a charitable
institution, Mr Müller, with meekness of spirit, at once relinquished
all claim upon the premises, being mindful of the maxim of Scripture:
"As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men." (Rom. xiii. 18.)
He felt sure that the Lord would provide, and his faith was rewarded in
the speedy supply of a building in the same street where the other two
houses were.

Infirmity of the flesh again tried the faith and patience of Mr. Müller.
For eight weeks he was kept out of the pulpit. The strange weakness in
the head, from which he had suffered before and which at times seemed to
threaten his reason, forced him to rest; and in November he went to Bath
and Weston-super-Mare, leaving to higher Hands the work to which he was
unequal.

One thing he noticed and recorded: that, even during this head trouble,
prayer and Bible-reading could be borne better than anything else. He
concluded that whenever undue carefulness is expended on the body, it is
very hard to avoid undue carelessness as to the soul; and that it is
therefore much safer comparatively to disregard the body, that one may
give himself wholly to the culture of his spiritual health and the care
of the Lord''s work. Though some may think that in this he ran to a
fanatical extreme, there is no doubt that such became more and more a
law of his life. He sought to dismiss all anxiety, as a duty; and, among
other anxious cares, that most subtle and seductive form of solicitude
which watches every change of symptoms and rushes after some new medical
man or medical remedy for all ailments real or fancied.

Mr. Müller was never actually reckless of his bodily health. His habits
were temperate and wholesome, but no man could be so completely wrapped
up in his Master''s will and work without being correspondingly forgetful
of his physical frame. There are not a few, even among God''s saints,
whose bodily weaknesses and distresses so engross them that their sole
business seems to be to nurse the body, keep it alive and promote its
comfort. As Dr. Watts would have said, this is living "at a poor dying
rate."

When the year 1838 opened, the weakness and distress in the head still
afflicted Mr. Müller. The symptoms were as bad as ever, and it
particularly tried him that they were attended by a tendency to
irritability of temper, and even by a sort of satanic feeling wholly
foreign to him at other times. He was often reminded that he was by
nature a child of wrath even as others, and that, as a child of God, he
could stand against the wiles of the devil only by putting on the whole
armour of God. The pavilion of God is the saint''s place of rest; the
panoply of God is his coat of mail. Grace does not at once remove or
overcome all tendencies to evil, but, if not eradicated, they are
counteracted by the Spirit''s wondrous working. Peter found that so
long as his eye was on His Master he could walk on the water. There is
always a tendency to sink, and a holy walk with God, that defies the
tendency downward, is a divine art that can neither be learned nor
practised except so long as we keep ''looking unto Jesus'': that look of
faith counteracts the natural tendency to sink, so long as it holds the
soul closely to Him. This man of God felt his risk, and, sore as this
trial was to him, he prayed not so much for its removal as that he might
be kept from any open dishonour to the name of the Lord, beseeching God
that he might rather die than ever bring on Him reproach.

Mr. Müller''s journal is not only a record of his outer life of
consecrated labour and its expansion, but it is a mirror of his inner
life and its growth. It is an encouragement to all other saints to find
that this growth was, like their own, in spite of many and formidable
hindrances, over which only grace could triumph. Side by side with
glimpses of habitual conscientiousness and joy in God, we have
revelations of times of coldness and despondency. It is a wholesome
lesson in holy living that we find this man setting himself to the
deliberate task of cultivating obedience and gratitude; by the culture
of obedience growing in knowledge and strength, and by the culture of
gratitude growing in thankfulness and love. Weakness and coldness are
not hopeless states: they have their divine remedies which strengthen
and warm the whole being.

Three entries, found side by side in his journal, furnish pertinent
illustration and most wholesome instruction on this point. One entry
records his deep thankfulness to God for the privilege of being
permitted to be His instrument in providing for homeless orphans, as he
watches the little girls, clad in clean warm garments, pass his window
on their way to the chapel on the Lord''s day morning. A second entry
records his determination, with God''s help, to send no more letters in
parcels because he sees it to be a violation of the postal laws of the
land, and because he desires, as a disciple of the Lord Jesus, to submit
himself to all human laws so far as such submission does not conflict
with loyalty to God. A third entry immediately follows which reveals
this same man struggling against those innate tendencies to evil which
compel a continual resort to the throne of grace with its sympathizing
High Priest. "This morning," he writes, "I greatly dishonoured the Lord
by irritability manifested towards my dear wife; and that, almost
immediately after I had been on my knees before God, praising Him for
having given me such a wife."

These three entries, put together, convey a lesson which is not learned
from either of them alone. Here is gratitude for divine mercy,
conscientious resolve at once to stop a doubtful practice, and a
confession of inconsistency in his home life. All of these are typical
experiences and suggest to us means of gracious growth. He who lets no
mercy of God escape thankful recognition, who never hesitates at once to
abandon an evil or questionable practice, and who, instead of
extenuating a sin because it is comparatively small, promptly confesses
and forsakes it,—such a man will surely grow in Christlikeness.

We must exercise our spiritual senses if we are to discern things
spiritual. There is a clear vision for God''s goodness, and there is a
dull eye that sees little to be thankful for; there is a tender
conscience, and there is a moral sense that grows less and less
sensitive to evil; there is an obedience to the Spirit''s rebuke which
leads to immediate confession and increases strength for every new
conflict. Mr. Müller cultivated habits of life which made his whole
nature more and more open to divine impression, and so his sense of God
became more and more keen and constant.

One great result of this spiritual culture was a growing absorption in
God and jealousy for His glory. As he saw divine things more clearly and
felt their supreme importance, he became engrossed in the magnifying of
them before men; and this is glorifying God. We cannot make God
essentially any more glorious, for He is infinitely perfect; but we can
help men to see what a glorious God He is, and thus come into that holy
partnership with the Spirit of God whose office it is to take of the
things of Christ and show them unto men, and so glorify Christ. Such
fellowship in glorifying God Mr. Müller set before him: and in the light
of such sanctified aspiration we may read that humble entry in which,
reviewing the year 1837 with all its weight of increasing
responsibility, he lifts his heart to his divine Lord and Master in
these simple words:

"Lord, Thy servant is a poor man; but he has trusted in Thee and made
his boast in Thee before the sons of men; therefore let him not be
confounded! Let it not be said, ''All this is enthusiasm, and therefore
it is come to naught.''"

One is reminded of Moses in his intercession for Israel, of Elijah in
his exceeding jealousy for the Lord of hosts, and of that prayer of
Jeremiah that so amazes us by its boldness:

Looking back over the growth of the work at the end of the year 1837, he
puts on record the following facts and figures:

Three orphan houses were now open with eighty-one children, and nine
helpers in charge of them. In the Sunday-schools there were three
hundred and twenty, and in the day-schools three hundred and fifty; and
the Lord had furnished over three hundred and seven pounds for temporal
supplies.

From this same point of view it may be well to glance back over the five
years of labour in Bristol up to July, 1837. Between himself and his
brother Craik uninterrupted harmony had existed from the beginning. They
had been perfectly at one in their views of the truth, in their witness
to the truth, and in their judgment as to all matters affecting the
believers over whom the Holy Ghost had made them overseers. The children
of God had been kept from heresy and schism under their joint pastoral
care; and all these blessings Mr. Müller and his true yoke-fellow humbly
traced to the mercy and grace of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls.
Thus far over one hundred and seventy had been converted and admitted to
fellowship, making the total number of communicants three hundred and
seventy, nearly equally divided between Bethesda and Gideon. The whole
history of these years is lit up with the sunlight of God''s smile and
blessing.

HABIT both shows and makes the man, for it is at once historic and
prophetic, the mirror of the man as he is and the mould of the man as he
is to be. At this point, therefore, special attention may properly be
given to the two marked habits which had principally to do with the man
we are studying.

Early in the year 1838, he began reading that third biography which,
with those of Francke and John Newton, had such a singular influence on
his own life—Philip''s Life of George Whitefield. The life-story of the
orphan''s friend had given the primary impulse to his work; the
life-story of the converted blasphemer had suggested his narrative of
the Lord''s dealings; and now the life-story of the great evangelist was
blessed of God to shape his general character and give new power to his
preaching and his wider ministry to souls. These three biographies
together probably affected the whole inward and outward life of George
Müller more than any other volumes but the Book of God, and they were
wisely fitted of God to co-work toward such a blessed result. The
example of Francke incited to faith in prayer and to a work whose sole
dependence was on God. Newton''s witness to grace led to a testimony to
the same sovereign love and mercy as seen in his own case. Whitefield''s
experience inspired to greater fidelity and earnestness in preaching the
Word, and to greater confidence in the power of the anointing Spirit.

Particularly was this impression deeply made on Mr. Müller''s mind and
heart: that Whitefield''s unparalleled success in evangelistic labours
was plainly traceable to two causes and could not be separated from them
as direct effects; namely, his unusual prayerfulness, and his habit of
reading the Bible on his knees.

The great evangelist of the last century had learned that first lesson
in service, his own utter nothingness and helplessness: that he was
nothing, and could do nothing, without God. He could neither understand
the Word for himself, nor translate it into his own life, nor apply it
to others with power, unless the Holy Spirit became to him both
insight and unction. Hence his success; he was filled with the
Spirit: and this alone accounts both for the quality and the quantity of
his labours. He died in 1770, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, having
preached his first sermon in Gloucester in 1736. During this thirty-four
years his labours had been both unceasing and untiring. While on his
journeyings in America, he preached one hundred and seventy-five times
in seventy-five days, besides travelling, in the slow vehicles of those
days, upwards of eight hundred miles. When health declined, and he was
put on ''short allowance,'' even that was one sermon each week-day and
three on Sunday. There was about his preaching, moreover, a nameless
charm which held thirty thousand hearers half-breathless on Boston
Common and made tears pour down the sooty faces of the colliers at
Kingswood.

The passion of George Müller''s soul was to know fully the secrets of
prevailing with God and with man. George Whitefield''s life drove home
the truth that God alone could create in him a holy earnestness to win
souls and qualify him for such divine work by imparting a compassion for
the lost that should become an absorbing passion for their salvation.
And—let this be carefully marked as another secret of this life of
service—he now began himself to read the word of God upon his knees,
and often found for hours great blessing in such meditation and prayer
over a single psalm or chapter.

Here we stop and ask what profit there can be in thus prayerfully
reading and searching the Scriptures in the very attitude of prayer.
Having tried it for ourselves, we may add our humble witness to its
value.

First of all, this habit is a constant reminder and recognition of the
need of spiritual teaching in order to the understanding of the holy
Oracles. No reader of God''s word can thus bow before God and His open
book, without a feeling of new reverence for the Scriptures, and
dependence on their Author for insight into their mysteries. The
attitude of worship naturally suggests sober-mindedness and deep
seriousness, and banishes frivolity. To treat that Book with lightness
or irreverence would be doubly profane when one is in the posture of
prayer.

Again, such a habit naturally leads to self-searching and comparison of
the actual life with the example and pattern shown in the Word. The
precept compels the practice to be seen in the light of its teaching;
the command challenges the conduct to appear for examination. The
prayer, whether spoken or unspoken, will inevitably be:

"Search me, O God, and know my heart,
        Try me, and know my thoughts;
        And see if there be any wicked way in me,
        And lead me in the way everlasting!"
            (Psalm cxxxix. 23, 24.)

The words thus reverently read will be translated into the life and
mould the character into the image of God. "Beholding as in a glass the
glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image from glory to
glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit."*

But perhaps the greatest advantage will be that the Holy Scriptures will
thus suggest the very words which become the dialect of prayer. "We know
not what we should pray for as we ought"—neither what nor how to pray.
But here is the Spirit''s own inspired utterance, and, if the praying be
moulded on the model of His teaching, how can we go astray? Here is our
God-given liturgy and litany—a divine prayer-book. We have here God''s
promises, precepts, warnings, and counsels, not to speak of all the
Spirit-inspired literal prayers therein contained; and, as we reflect
upon these, our prayers take their cast in this matrix. We turn precept
and promise, warning and counsel into supplication, with the assurance
that we cannot be asking anything that is not according to His will,*
for are we not turning His own word into prayer?

So Mr. Müller found it to be. In meditating over Hebrews xiii. 8: "Jesus
Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever," translating it into
prayer, he besought God, with the confidence that the prayer was already
granted, that, as Jesus had already in His love and power supplied all
that was needful, in the same unchangeable love and power He would so
continue to provide. And so a promise was not only turned into a prayer,
but into a prophecy—an assurance of blessing—and a river of joy at
once poured into and flowed through his soul.

The prayer habit, on the knees, with the Word open before the disciple,
has thus an advantage which it is difficult to put into words: It
provides a sacred channel of approach to God. The inspired Scriptures
form the vehicle of the Spirit in communicating to us the knowledge of
the will of God. If we think of God on the one side and man on the
other, the word of God is the mode of conveyance from God to man, of His
own mind and heart. It therefore becomes a channel of God''s approach to
us, a channel prepared by the Spirit for the purpose, and unspeakably
sacred as such. When therefore the believer uses the word of God as the
guide to determine both the spirit and the dialect of his prayer, he is
inverting the process of divine revelation and using the channel of
God''s approach to him as the channel of his approach to God. How can
such use of God''s word fail to help and strengthen spiritual life? What
medium or channel of approach could so insure in the praying soul both
an acceptable frame and language taught of the Holy Spirit? If the first
thing is not to pray but to hearken, this surely is hearkening for God
to speak to us that we may know how to speak to Him.

It was habits of life such as these, and not impulsive feelings and
transient frames, that made this man of God what he was and strengthened
him to lift up his hands in God''s name, and follow hard after Him and in
Him rejoice.* Even his sore affliction, seen in the light of such
prayer—prayer itself illuminated by the word of God—became radiant;
and his soul was brought into that state where he so delighted in the
will of God as to be able from his heart to say that he would not have
his disease removed until through it God had wrought the blessing it was
meant to convey. And when his acquiescence in the will of God had become
thus complete he instinctively felt that he would speedily be restored
to health.

Subsequently, in reading Proverbs iii. 5-12, he was struck with the
words, "Neither be weary of His correction." He felt that, though he
had not been permitted to "despise the chastening of the Lord," he had
at times been somewhat "weary of His correction," and he lifted up the
prayer that he might so patiently bear it as neither to faint nor be
weary under it, till its full purpose was wrought.

Frequent were the instances of the habit of translating promises into
prayers, immediately applying the truth thus unveiled to him. For
example, after prolonged meditation over the first verse of Psalm lxv,
"O Thou that hearest prayer," he at once asked and recorded certain
definite petitions. This writing down specific requests for permanent
reference has a blessed influence upon the prayer habit. It assures
practical and exact form for our supplications, impresses the mind and
memory with what is thus asked of God, and leads naturally to the record
of the answers when given, so that we accumulate evidences in our own
experience that God is to us personally a prayer-hearing God, whereby
unbelief is rebuked and importunity encouraged.

On this occasion eight specific requests are put on record, together
with the solemn conviction that, having asked in conformity with the
word and will of God, and in the name of Jesus, he has confidence in Him
that He heareth and that he has the petitions thus asked of Him.* He
writes:

"I believe He has heard me. I believe He will make it manifest in
His own good time that He has heard me; and I have recorded these my
petitions this fourteenth day of January, 1838, that when God has
answered them He may get, through this, glory to His name."

The thoughtful reader must see in all this a man of weak faith, feeding
and nourishing his trust in God that his faith may grow strong. He uses
the promise of a prayer-hearing God as a staff to stay his conscious
feebleness, that he may lean hard upon the strong Word which cannot
fail. He records the day when he thus takes this staff in hand, and the
very petitions which are the burdens which he seeks to lay on God, so
that his act of committal may be the more complete and final. Could God
ever dishonour such trust?

It was in this devout reading on his knees that his whole soul was first
deeply moved by that phrase,

He saw this to be one of those "names" of Jehovah which He reveals to
His people to lead them to trust in Him, as it is written in Psalm ix.
10:

These five words from the sixty-eighth psalm became another of his
life-texts, one of the foundation stones of all his work for the
fatherless. These are his own words:

"By the help of God, this shall be my argument before Him, respecting
the orphans, in the hour of need. He is their Father, and therefore has
pledged Himself, as it were, to provide for them; and I have only to
remind Him of the need of these poor children in order to have it
supplied."

This is translating the promises of God''s word, not only into praying,
but into living, doing, serving. Blessed was the hour when Mr. Müller
learned that one of God''s chosen names is "the Father of the
fatherless"!

To sustain such burdens would have been quite impossible but for faith
in such a God. In reply to oft-repeated remarks of visitors and
observers who could not understand the secret of his peace, or how any
man who had so many children to clothe and feed could carry such
prostrating loads of care, he had one uniform reply: "By the grace of
God, this is no cause of anxiety to me. These children I have years ago
cast upon the Lord. The whole work is His, and it becomes me to be
without carefulness. In whatever points I am lacking, in this point I am
able by the grace of God to roll the burden upon my heavenly Father."*

In tens of thousands of cases this peculiar title of God, chosen by
Himself and by Himself declared, became to Mr. Müller a peculiar
revelation of God, suited to his special need. The natural inferences
drawn from such a title became powerful arguments in prayer, and rebukes
to all unbelief. Thus, at the outset of his work for the orphans, the
word of God put beneath his feet a rock basis of confidence that he
could trust the almighty Father to support the work. And, as the
solicitudes of the work came more and more heavily upon him, he cast the
loads he could not carry upon Him who, before George Müller was born,
was the Father of the fatherless.

About this time we meet other signs of the conflict going on in Mr.
Müllers own soul. He could not shut his eyes to the lack of earnestness
in prayer and fervency of spirit which at times seemed to rob him of
both peace and power. And we notice his experience, in common with so
many saints, of the paradox of spiritual life. He saw that "such
fervency of spirit is altogether the gift of God," and yet he adds, "I
have to ascribe to myself the loss of it." He did not run divine
sovereignty into blank fatalism as so many do. He saw that God must be
sovereign in His gifts, and yet man must be free in his reception and
rejection of them. He admitted the mystery without attempting to
reconcile the apparent contradiction. He confesses also that the same
book, Philip''s Life of Whitefield, which had been used of God to kindle
such new fires on the altar of his heart, had been also used of Satan to
tempt him to neglect for its sake the systematic study of the greatest
of books.

Thus, at every step, George Müllers life is full of both encouragement
and admonition to fellow disciples. While away from Bristol he wrote in
February, 1838, a tender letter to the saints there, which is another
revelation of the man''s heart. He makes grateful mention of the mercies
of God, to him, particularly His gentleness, long-suffering, and
faithfulness and the lessons taught him through affliction. The letter
makes plain that much sweetness is mixed in the cup of suffering, and
that our privileges are not properly prized until for a time we are
deprived of them. He particularly mentions how secret prayer, even
when reading, conversation, or prayer with others was a burden, always
brought relief to his head. Converse with the Father was an
indispensable source of refreshment and blessing at all times. As J.
Hudson Taylor says "Satan, the Hinderer, may build a barrier about us,
but he can never roof us in, so that we cannot look up." Mr. Müller
also gives a valuable hint that has already been of value to many
afflicted saints, that he found he could help by prayer to fight the
battles of the Lord even when he could not by preaching. After a short
visit to Germany, partly in quest of health and partly for missionary
objects, and after more than twenty-two weeks of retirement from
ordinary public duties, his head was much better, but his mental health
allowed only about three hours of daily work. While in Germany he had
again seen his father and elder brother, and spoken with them about
their salvation. To his father his words brought apparent blessing, for
he seemed at least to feel his lack of the one thing needful. The
separation from him was the more painful as there was so little hope
that they should meet again on earth.

In May he once more took part in public services in Bristol, a period of
six months having elapsed since he had previously done so. His head was
still weak, but there seemed no loss of mental power.

About three months after he had been in Germany part of the fruits of
his visit were gathered, for twelve brothers and three sisters sailed
for the East Indies.

On June 13, 1838, Mrs. Müller gave birth to a stillborn babe,—another
parental disappointment,—and for more than a fortnight her life hung in
the balance. But once more prayer prevailed for her and her days were
prolonged.

One month later another trial of faith confronted them in the orphan
work. A twelvemonth previous there were in hand seven hundred and eighty
pounds; now that sum was reduced to one thirty-ninth of the
amount—twenty pounds. Mr. and Mrs. Müller, with Mr. Craik and one other
brother, connected with the Boys'' Orphan House, were the only four
persons who were permitted to know of the low state of funds; and they
gave themselves to united prayer. And let it be carefully observed that
Mr. Müller testifies that his own faith was kept even stronger than when
the larger sum was on hand a year before; and this faith was no mere
fancy, for, although the supply was so low and shortly thirty pounds
would be needed, notice was given for seven more children to enter, and
it was further proposed to announce readiness to receive five others!

The trial-hour had come, but was not past. Less than two months later
the money-supply ran so low that it was needful that the Lord should
give by the day and almost by the hour if the needs were to be met. In
answer to prayer for help God seemed to say, "Mine hour is not yet
come." Many pounds would shortly be required, toward which there was not
one penny in hand. When, one day, over four pounds came in, the thought
occurred to Mr. Müller, "Why not lay aside three pounds against the
coming need?" But immediately he remembered that it is written:
"SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY is THE EVIL THEREOF."* He unhesitatingly cast
himself upon God, and paid out the whole amount for salaries then due,
leaving himself again penniless.

At this time Mr. Craik was led to read a sermon on Abraham, from Genesis
xii, making prominent two facts: first, that so long as he acted in
faith and walked in the will of God, all went on well; but that,
secondly, so far as he distrusted the Lord and disobeyed Him, all ended
in failure. Mr. Müller heard this sermon and conscientiously applied it
to himself. He drew two most practical conclusions which he had abundant
opportunity to put into practice:

And, secondly, that in proportion as he had been permitted to honour God
and bring some glory to His name by trusting Him, he was in danger of
dishonouring Him.

Having taught him these blessed truths, the Lord tested him as to how
far he would venture upon them. While in such sore need of money for the
orphan work, he had in the bank some two hundred and twenty pounds,
intrusted to him for other purposes. He might use this money for the
time at least, and so relieve the present distress. The temptation was
the stronger so to do, because he knew the donors and knew them to be
liberal supporters of the orphans; and he had only to explain to them
the straits he was in and they would gladly consent to any appropriation
of their gift that he might see best! Most men would have cut that
Gordian knot of perplexity without hesitation.

Not so George Müller. He saw at once that this would be finding a way
of his own out of difficulty, instead of waiting on the Lord for
deliverance. Moreover, he also saw that it would be forming a habit of
trusting to such expedients of his own, which in other trials would lead
to a similar course and so hinder the growth of faith. We use italics
here because here is revealed one of the tests by which this man of
faith, was proven; and we see how he kept consistently and persistently
to the one great purpose of his life—to demonstrate to all men that to
rest solely on I the promise of a faithful God is the only way to know
for one''s self and prove to others, His faithfulness.

At this time of need—the type of many others—this man who had
determined to risk everything upon God''s word of promise, turned from
doubtful devices and questionable methods of relief to pleading with
God. And it may be well to mark his manner of pleading. He used
argument in prayer, and at this time he piles up eleven reasons why
God should and would send help.

This method of holy argument—ordering our cause before God, as an
advocate would plead before a judge—is not only almost a lost art, but
to many it actually seems almost puerile. And yet it is abundantly
taught and exemplified in Scripture. Abraham in his plea for Sodom is
the first great example of it. Moses excelled in this art, in many
crises interceding in behalf of the people with consummate skill,
marshalling arguments as a general-in-chief marshals battalions. Elijah
on Carmel is a striking example of power in this special pleading. What
holy zeal and jealousy for God! It is probable that if we had fuller
records we should find that all pleaders with God, like Noah, Job,
Samuel, David, Daniel, Jeremiah, Paul, and James, have used the same
method.

Of course God does not need to be convinced: no arguments can make any
plainer to Him the claims of trusting souls to His intervention, claims
based upon His own word, confirmed by His oath. And yet He will be
inquired of and argued with. That is His way of blessing. He loves to
have us set before Him our cause and His own promises: He delights in
the well-ordered plea, where argument is piled upon argument. See how
the Lord Jesus Christ commended the persistent argument of the woman of
Canaan, who with the wit of importunity actually turned his own
objection into a reason. He said, "It is not meet to take the
children''s bread and cast it to the little dogs."* "Truth, Lord," she
answered, "yet the little dogs under the master''s tables eat of the
crumbs which fall from the children''s mouths!" What a triumph of
argument! Catching the Master Himself in His words, as He meant she
should, and turning His apparent reason for not granting into a reason
for granting her request! "O woman," said He, "great is thy faith! Be it
unto thee even as thou wilt"—thus, as Luther said, "flinging the reins
on her neck."

This case stands unique in the word of God, and it is this use of
argument in prayer that makes it thus solitary in grandeur. But one
other case is at all parallel,—that of the centurion of Capernaum,*
who, when our Lord promised to go and heal his servant, argued that such
coming was not needful, since He had only to speak the healing word. And
notice the basis of his argument: if he, a commander exercising
authority and yielding himself to higher authority, both obeyed the word
of his superior and exacted obedience of his subordinate, how much more
could the Great Healer, in his absence, by a word of command, wield the
healing Power that in His presence was obedient to His will! Of him
likewise our Lord said: "I have not found so great faith, no, not in
Israel!"

We are to argue our case with God, not indeed to convince Him, but to
convince ourselves. In proving to Him that, by His own word and oath
and character, He has bound Himself to interpose, we demonstrate to our
own faith that He has given us the right to ask and claim, and that He
will answer our plea because He cannot deny Himself.

There are two singularly beautiful touches of the Holy Spirit in which
the right thus to order argument before God is set forth to the
reflective reader. In Micah. vii. 20 we read:

"Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
        The mercy to Abraham,
        Which thou hast sworn unto our fathers,
        From the days of old."

Mark the progress of the thought. What was mercy to Abraham was truth to
Jacob. God was under no obligation to extend covenant blessings; hence
it was to Abraham a simple act of pure mercy; but, having so put
Himself under voluntary bonds, Jacob could claim as truth what to
Abraham had been mercy. So in 1 John i. 9:

"If we confess our sins
        He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
        And to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

Plainly, forgiveness and cleansing are not originally matters of
faithfulness and justice, but of mercy and grace. But, after God had
pledged Himself thus to forgive and cleanse the penitent sinner who
confesses and forsakes his sins,* what was originally grace and mercy
becomes faithfulness and justice; for God owes it to Himself and to His
creature to stand by His own pledge, and fulfil the lawful expectation
which His own gracious assurance has created.

Thus we have not only examples of argument in prayer, but concessions of
the living God Himself, that when we have His word to plead we may claim
the fulfillment of His promise, on the ground not of His mercy only, but
of His truth, faithfulness, and justice. Hence the ''holy boldness with
which we are bidden to present our plea at the throne of grace. God owes
to His faithfulness to do what He has promised, and to His justice not
to exact from the sinner a penalty already borne in his behalf by His
own Son.

No man of his generation, perhaps, has been more wont to plead thus with
God, after the manner of holy argument, than he whose memoir we are now
writing. He was one of the elect few to whom it has been given to revive
and restore this lost art of pleading with God. And if all disciples
could learn the blessed lesson, what a period of renaissance of faith
would come to the church of God!

George Müller stored up reasons for God''s intervention, As he came upon
promises, authorized declarations of God concerning Himself, names and
titles He had chosen to express and reveal His true nature and will,
injunctions and invitations which gave to the believer a right to pray
and boldness in supplication—as he saw all these, fortified and
exemplified by the instances of prevailing prayer, he laid these
arguments up in memory, and then on occasions of great need brought them
out and spread them before a prayer-hearing God. It is pathetically
beautiful to follow this humble man of God into the secret place, and
there hear him pouring out his soul in these argumentative pleadings, as
though he would so order his cause before God as to convince Him that He
must interpose to save His own name and word from dishonour!

These were His orphans, for had He not declared Himself the Father of
the fatherless? This was His work, for had He not called His servant
to do His bidding, and what was that servant but an instrument that
could neither fit itself nor use itself? Can the rod lift itself, or the
saw move itself, or the hammer deal its own blow, or the sword make its
own thrust? And if this were God''s work, was He not bound to care for
His own work? And was not all this deliberately planned and carried on
for His own glory? And would He suffer His own glory to be dimmed? Had
not His own word been given and confirmed by His oath, and could God
allow His promise, thus sworn to, to be dishonoured even in the least
particular? Were not the half-believing church and the unbelieving world
looking on, to see how the Living God would stand by His own unchanging
assurance, and would He supply an argument for the skeptic and the
scoffer? Would He not, must He not, rather put new proofs of His
faithfulness in the mouth of His saints, and furnish increasing
arguments wherewith to silence the cavilling tongue and put to shame the
hesitating disciple?*

* Mr. Müller himself tells how he argued his case before the Lord at
this time. (Appendix F. Narrative, vol. 1, 243, 244)

In some such fashion as this did this lowly-minded saint in Bristol
plead with God for more than threescore years, and prevail—as every
true believer may who with a like boldness comes to the throne of grace
to obtain mercy and find grace to help in every time of need. How few of
us can sincerely sing:

I believe God answers prayer,
        Answers always, everywhere;
        I may cast my anxious care,
        Burdens I could never bear,
        On the God who heareth prayer.
        Never need my soul despair
        Since He bids me boldly dare
        To the secret place repair,
        There to prove He answers prayer.

GOD has His own mathematics: witness that miracle of the loaves and
fishes. Our Lord said to His disciples: "Give ye them to eat," and as
they divided, He multiplied the scanty provision; as they subtracted
from it He added to it; as they decreased it by distributing, He
increased it for distributing. And it has been beautifully said of all
holy partnerships, that griefs shared are divided, and joys shared are
multiplied.

We have already seen how the prayer circle had been enlarged. The
founder of the orphan work, at the first, had only God for his partner,
telling Him alone his own wants or the needs of his work. Later on, a
very few, including his own wife, Mr. Craik, and one or two helpers,
were permitted to know the condition of the funds and supplies. Later
still, in the autumn of 1838, he began to feel that he ought more fully
to open the doors of his confidence to his associates in the Lord''s
business. Those who shared in the toils should also share in the
prayers, and therefore in the knowledge of the needs which prayer was to
supply; else how could they fully be partakers of the faith, the work,
and the reward? Or, again, how could they feel the full proof of the
presence and power of God in the answers to prayer, know the joy of the
Lord which such answers inspire, or praise Him for the deliverance which
such answers exhibit? It seemed plain that, to the highest glory of God,
they must know the depths of need, the extremities of want out of which
God had lifted them, and then ascribe all honour and praise to His name.

Accordingly Mr. Müller called together all the beloved brothers and
sisters linked with him in the conduct of the work, and fully stated the
case, keeping nothing back. He showed them the distress they were in,
while he bade them be of good courage, assuring them of his own
confidence that help was nigh at hand, and then united them with himself
and the smaller praying circle which had previously existed, in
supplication to Jehovah Jireh.

The step thus taken was of no small importance to all concerned. A
considerable number of praying believers were henceforth added to the
band of intercessors that gave God no rest day nor night. While Mr.
Müller withheld no facts as to the straits to which the work was
reduced, he laid down certain principles which from time to time were
reiterated as unchanging laws for the conduct of the Lord''s business.
For example, nothing must be bought, whatever the extremity, for which
there was not money in hand to pay: and yet it must be equally a settled
principle that the children must not be left to lack anything needful;
for better that the work cease, and the orphans be sent away, than that
they be kept in a nominal home where they were really left to suffer
from hunger or nakedness.

Again, nothing was ever to be revealed to outsiders of existing need,
lest it should be construed into an appeal for help; but the only resort
must be to the living God. The helpers were often reminded that the
supreme object of the institutions, founded in Bristol, was to prove
God''s faithfulness and the perfect safety of trusting solely to His
promises; jealousy for Him must therefore restrain all tendency to look
to man for help. Moreover, they were earnestly besought to live in such
daily and hourly fellowship with God as that their own unbelief and
disobedience might not risk either their own power in prayer, or the
agreement, needful among them, in order to common supplication. One
discordant note may prevent the harmonious symphony of united prayer,
and so far hinder the acceptableness of such prayer with God.

Thus informed and instructed, these devoted coworkers, with the beloved
founder of the orphan work, met the crisis intelligently. If, when there
were no funds, there must be no leaning upon man, no debt incurred,
and yet no lack allowed, clearly the only resort or resource must be
waiting upon the unseen God; and so, in these straits and in every
succeeding crisis, they went to Him alone. The orphans themselves were
never told of any existing need; in every case their wants were met,
though they knew not how. The barrel of meal might be empty, yet there
was always a handful when needed, and the cruse of oil was never so
exhausted that a few drops were not left to moisten the handful of meal.
Famine and drought never reached the Bristol orphanage: the supplies
might come slowly and only for one day at a time, but somehow, when the
need was urgent and could no longer wait, there was enough—though it
might be barely enough to meet the want.

It should be added here, as completing this part of the Narrative, that,
in August, 1840, this circle of prayer was still further enlarged by
admitting to its intimacies of fellowship and supplication the brethren
and sisters who laboured in the day-schools, the same solemn injunctions
being repeated in their case against any betrayal to outsiders of the
crises that might arise.

To impart the knowledge of affairs to so much larger a band of helpers
brought in every way a greater blessing, and especially so to the
helpers themselves. Their earnest, believing, importunate prayers were
thus called forth, and God only knows how much the consequent progress
of the work was due to their faith, supplication, and self-denial. The
practical knowledge of the exigencies of their common experience begat
an unselfishness of spirit which prompted countless acts of heroic
sacrifice that have no human record or written history, and can be known
only when the pages of the Lord''s own journal are read by an assembled
universe in the day when the secret things are brought to light. It has,
since Mr. Müller''s departure, transpired how large a share of the
donations received are to be traced to him; but there is no means of
ascertaining as to the aggregate amount of the secret gifts of his
coworkers in this sacred circle of prayer.

We do know, however, that Mr. Müller was not the only self-denying
giver, though he may lead the host. His true yoke-fellows often turned
the crisis by their own offerings, which though small were costly!
Instrumentally they were used of God to relieve existing want by their
gifts, for out of the abundance of their deep poverty abounded the
riches of their liberality. The money they gave was sometimes like the
widow''s two mites—all their living; and not only the last penny, but
ornaments, jewels, heirlooms, long-kept and cherished treasures, like
the alabaster flask of ointment which was broken upon the feet of Jesus,
were laid down on God''s altar as a willing sacrifice. They gave all they
could spare and often what they could ill spare, so that there might be
meat in God''s house and no lack of bread or other needed supplies for
His little ones. In a sublime sense this work was not Mr. Müllers only,
but theirs also, who with him took part in prayers and tears, in cares
and toils, in self-denials and self-offerings, whereby God chose to
carry forward His plans for these homeless waifs! It was in thus
giving that all these helpers found also new power, assurance, and
blessing in praying; for, as one of them said, he felt that it would
scarcely be "upright to pray, except he were to give what he had."*

The helpers, thus admitted into Mr. Müller''s confidence, came into more
active sympathy with him and the work, and partook increasingly of the
same spirit. Of this some few instances and examples have found their
way into his journal.

A gentleman and some ladies visiting the orphan houses saw the large
number of little ones to be cared for. One of the ladies said to the
matron of the Boys'' House: "Of course you cannot carry on these
institutions without a good stock of funds"; and the gentleman added,
"Have you a good stock?" The quiet answer was, "Our funds are deposited
in a bank which cannot break." The reply drew tears from the eyes of the
lady, and a gift of five pounds from the pocket of the gentleman—a
donation most opportune, as there was not one penny then in hand.

Fellow labourers such as these, who asked nothing for themselves, but
cheerfully looked to the Lord for their own supplies, and willingly
parted with their own money or goods in the hour of need, filled Mr.
Müller''s heart with praise to God, and held up his hands, as Aaron and
Hur sustained those of Moses, till the sun of his life went down. During
all the years of his superintendence these were the main human support
of his faith and courage. They met with him in daily prayer, faithfully
kept among themselves the secrets of the Lord''s work in the great trials
of faith; and, when the hour of triumph came, they felt it to be both
duty and privilege in the annual report to publish their deliverance, to
make their boast in God, that all men might know His love and
faithfulness and ascribe unto Him glory.

From time to time, in connection with the administration of the work,
various questions arose which have a wider bearing on all departments of
Christian service, for their solution enters into what may be called the
ethics and economics of the Lord''s work. At a few of these we may
glance.

As the Lord was dealing with them by the day, it seemed clear that they
were to live by the day. No dues [Transcriber''s note: unpaid debts]
should be allowed to accumulate, even such as would naturally accrue
from ordinary weekly supplies of bread, milk, etc. From the middle of
September, 1838, it was therefore determined that every article bought
was to be paid for at the time.

Again, rent became due in stated amounts and at stated times. This want
was therefore not unforeseen, and, looked at in one aspect, rent was due
daily or weekly, though collected at longer intervals. The principle
having been laid down that no debt should be incurred, it was considered
as implying that the amount due for rent should be put aside daily, or
at least weekly, even though not then payable. This rule was henceforth
adopted, with this understanding, that money thus laid aside was sacred
to that end, and not to be drawn upon, even temporarily, for any other.

Notwithstanding such conscientiousness and consistency the trial of
faith and patience continued. Money came in only in small sums, and
barely enough with rigid economy to meet each day''s wants. The outlook
was often most dark and the prospect most threatening; but no real need
ever failed to be supplied: and so praise was continually mingled with
prayer, the incense of thanksgiving making fragrant the flame of
supplication. God''s interposing power and love could not be doubted, and
in fact made the more impression as unquestionable facts, because help
came so frequently at the hour of extremity, and in the exact form or
amount needed. Before the provision was entirely exhausted, there came
new supplies or the money wherewith to buy, so that these many mouths
were always fed and these many bodies always clad.

To live up to such principles as had been laid down was not possible
without faith, kept in constant and lively exercise. For example, in the
closing months of 1838 God seemed purposely putting them to a severe
test, whether or not they did trust Him alone. The orphan work was in
continual straits: at times not one half-penny was in the hands of the
matrons in the three houses. But not only was no knowledge of such facts
ever allowed to leak out, or any hint of the extreme need ever given to
outsiders, but even those who inquired, with intent to aid, were not
informed.

One evening a brother ventured to ask how the balance would stand when
the next accounts were made up, and whether it would be as great in
favour of the orphans as when the previous balance-sheet had been
prepared. Mr. Mutter''s calm but evasive answer was: "It will be as
great as the Lord pleases." This was no intentional rudeness. To have
said more would have been turning from the one Helper to make at least
an indirect appeal to man for help; and every such snare was carefully
avoided lest the one great aim should be lost sight of: to prove to all
men that it is safe to trust only in the Living God.

While admitting the severity of the straits to which the whole work of
the Scriptural Knowledge Institution was often brought, Mr. Müller takes
pains to assure his readers that these straits were never a surprise to
him, and that his expectations in the matter of funds were not
disappointed, but rather the reverse. He had looked for great
emergencies as essential to his full witness to a prayer-hearing God.
The almighty Hand can never be clearly seen while any human help is
sought for or is in sight. We must turn absolutely away from all else if
we are to turn fully unto the living God. The deliverance is signal,
only in proportion as the danger is serious, and is most significant
when, without God, we face absolute despair. Hence the exact end for
which the whole work was mainly begun could be attained only through
such conditions of extremity and such experiences of interposition in
extremity.

Some who have known but little of the interior history of the orphan
work have very naturally accounted for the regularity of supplies by
supposing that the public statements, made about it by word of mouth,
and especially by the pen in the printed annual reports, have
constituted appeals for aid. Unbelief would interpret all God''s
working however wonderful, by ''natural laws,'' and the carnal mind,
refusing to see in any of the manifestations of God''s power any
supernatural force at work, persists in thus explaining away all the
''miracles of prayer.''

No doubt humane and sympathetic hearts have been strongly moved by the
remarkable ways in which God has day by day provided for all these
orphans, as well as the other branches of work of the Scriptural
Knowledge Institution; and believing souls have been drawn into loving
and hearty sympathy with work so conducted, and have been led to become
its helpers. It is a well-known fact that God has used these annual
reports to accomplish just such results. Yet it remains true that these
reports were never intended or issued as appeals for aid, and no
dependence has been placed upon them for securing timely help. It is
also undeniable that, however frequent their issue, wide their
circulation, or great their influence, the regularity and abundance of
the supplies of all needs must in some other way be accounted for.

Only a few days after public meetings were held or printed reports
issued, funds often fell to their lowest ebb. Mr. Müller and his helpers
were singularly kept from all undue leaning upon any such indirect
appeals, and frequently and definitely asked God that they might never
be left to look for any inflow of means through such channels. For many
reasons the Lord''s dealings with them were made known, the main object
of such publicity always being a testimony to the faithfulness of God.
This great object Mr. Müller always kept foremost, hoping and praying
that, by such records and revelations of God''s fidelity to His promises,
and of the manner in which He met each new need, his servant might
awaken, quicken, and stimulate faith in Him as the Living God. One has
only to read these reports to see the conspicuous absence of any appeal
for human aid, or of any attempt to excite pity, sympathy and compassion
toward the orphans. The burden of every report is to induce the reader
to venture wholly upon God, to taste and see that the Lord is good, and
find for himself how blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.
Only in the light of this supreme purpose can these records of a life of
faith be read intelligently and intelligibly.

Weakness of body again, in the autumn of 1839, compelled, for a time,
rest from active labour, and Mr. Müller went to Trowbridge and Exeter,
Teignmouth and Plymouth. God had precious lessons for him which He could
best teach in the school of affliction.

While at Plymouth Mr. Müller felt anew the impulse to early rising for
purposes of devotional communion. At Halle he had been an early riser,
influenced by zeal for excellence in study. Afterwards, when his weak
head and feeble nerves made more sleep seem needful, he judged that,
even when he rose late, the day would be long enough to exhaust his
little fund of strength; and so often he lay in bed till six or even
seven o''clock, instead of rising at four; and after dinner took a nap
for a quarter-hour. It now grew upon him, however, that he was losing in
spiritual vigour, and that his soul''s health was declining under this
new regimen. The work now so pressed upon him as to prevent proper
reading of the Word and rob him of leisure for secret prayer.

A ''chance remark''—there is no chance in a believer''s life!—made by
the brother at whose house he was abiding at Plymouth, much impressed
him. Referring to the sacrifices in Leviticus, he said that, as the
refuse of the animals was never offered up on the altar, but only the
best parts and the fat, so the choicest of our time and strength, the
best parts of our day, should be especially given to the Lord in worship
and communion. George Müller meditated much on this; and determined,
even at the risk of damage to bodily health, that he would no longer
spend his best hours in bed. Henceforth he allowed himself but seven
hours'' sleep and gave up his after-dinner rest. This resumption of
early rising secured long seasons of uninterrupted interviews ''with God,
in prayer and meditation on the Scriptures, before breakfast and the
various inevitable interruptions that followed. He found himself not
worse but better, physically, and became convinced that to have lain
longer in bed as before would have kept his nerves weak; and, as to
spiritual life, such new vitality and vigour accrued from thus waiting
upon God while others slept, that it continued to be the habit of his
after-life.

In November, 1839, when the needs were again great and the supplies very
small, he was kept in peace: "I was not," he says, "looking at the
little in hand, ''but at the fulness of God."

It was his rule to empty himself of all that he had, in order to greater
boldness in appealing for help from above. All needless articles were
sold if a market could be found. But what was useful in the Lord''s work
he did not reckon as needless, nor regard it right to sell, since the
Father knew the need. One of his fellow labourers had put forward his
valuable watch as a security for the return of money laid by for rent,
but drawn upon for the time; yet even this plan was not felt to be
scriptural, as the watch might be reckoned among articles needful and
useful in the Lord''s service, and, if such, expedients were quite
abandoned, the deliverance would be more manifest as of the Lord. And
so, one by one, all resorts were laid aside that might imperil full
trust and sole dependence upon the one and only Helper.

When the poverty of their resources seemed most pinching, Mr. Müller
still comforted himself with the daily proof that God had not forgotten,
and would day by day feed them with ''the bread of their convenience.''
Often he said to himself, If it is even a proverb of the world that
"Man''s necessity is God''s opportunity," how much more may God''s own dear
children in their great need look to Him to make their extremity the fit
moment to display His love and power!

In February, 1840, another attack of ill health combined with a mission
to Germany to lead Mr. Müller for five weeks to the Continent. At
Heimersleben, where he found his father weakened by a serious cough, the
two rooms in which he spent most time in prayer and reading of the Word,
and confession of the Lord, were the same in which, nearly twenty years
before, he had passed most time as an unreconciled sinner against God
and man. Later on, at Wolfenbuttel, he saw the inn whence in 1821 he ran
away in debt. In taking leave once more of his father he was pierced by
a keen anguish, fearing it was his last farewell, and an unusual
tenderness and affection were now exhibited by his father, whom he
yearned more and more to know as safe in the Lord Jesus, and depending
no longer on outward and formal religiousness, or substituting the
reading of prayers and of Scripture for an inward conformity to Christ.
This proved the last interview, for the father died on March 30th of the
same year.

The main purpose of this journey to Germany was to send forth more
missionaries to the East. At Sandersleben Mr. Müller met his friend, Mr.
Stahlschmidt, and found a little band of disciples meeting in secret to
evade the police. Those who have always breathed the atmosphere of
religious liberty know little of such intolerance as, in that nominally
Christian land, stifled all freedom of Worship. Eleven years before,
when Mr. Stahlschmidt''s servant had come to this place, he had found
scarce one true disciple beside his master. The first meetings had been
literally of but two or three, and, when they had grown a little larger,
Mr. Kroll was summoned before the magistrates and, like the apostles in
the first days of the church, forbidden to speak in His name. But again,
like those same primitive disciples, believing that they were to obey
God rather than men, the believing band had continued to meet,
notwithstanding police raids which were so disturbing, and government
fines which were so exacting. So secret, however, were their assemblies,
as to have neither stated place nor regular time.

George Müller found these persecuted believers, meeting in the room of a
humble weaver where there was but one chair. The twenty-five or thirty
who were present found such places to sit or stand as they might, in and
about the loom, which itself filled half the space.

In Halberstadt Mr. Müller found seven large Protestant churches without
one clergyman who gave evidence of true conversion, and the few genuine
disciples there were likewise forbidden to meet together.

A few days after returning to Bristol from his few weeks in Germany, and
at a time of great financial distress in the work, a letter reached him
from a brother who had often before given money, as follows:

"Have you any present need for the Institution under your care? I know
you do not ask, except indeed of Him whose work you are doing; but to
answer when asked seems another thing, and a right thing. I have a
reason for desiring to know the present state of your means towards the
objects you are labouring to serve: viz., should you not have need,
other departments of the Lord''s work, or other people of the Lord, may
have need. Kindly then inform me, and to what amount, i.e. what amount
you at this present time need or can profitably lay out."

To most men, even those who carry on a work of faith and prayer, such a
letter would have been at least a temptation. But Mr. Müller did not
waver. To announce even to an inquirer the exact needs of the work
would, in his opinion, involve two serious risks:

This man of God had staked everything upon one great experiment—he had
set himself to prove that the prayer which resorts to God only will
bring help in every crisis, even when the crisis is unknown to His
people whom He uses as the means of relief and help.

At this time there remained in hand but twenty-seven pence ha''penny, in
all, to meet the needs of hundreds of orphans. Nevertheless this was the
reply to the letter:

"Whilst I thank you for your love, and whilst I agree with you that, in
general, there is a difference between asking for money and answering
when asked, nevertheless, in our case, I feel not at liberty to speak
about the state of our funds, as the primary object of the work in my
hands is to lead those who are weak in faith to see that there is
reality in dealing with God alone."

Consistently with his position, however, no sooner was the answer posted
than the appeal went up to the Living God: "Lord, thou knowest that, for
Thy sake, I did not tell this brother about our need. Now, Lord, show
afresh that there is reality in speaking to Thee only, about our need,
and speak therefore to this brother so that he may help us." In answer,
God moved this inquiring brother to send one hundred pounds, which came
when not one penny was in hand.

The confidence of faith, long tried, had its increasing reward and was
strengthened by experience. In July, 1845, Mr. Müller gave this
testimony reviewing these very years of trial:

"Though for about seven years, our funds have been so exhausted that it
has been comparatively a rare case that there have been means in hand to
meet the necessities of the orphans for three days together, yet I
have been only once tried in spirit, and that was on September 18, 1838,
when for the first time the Lord seemed not to regard our prayer. But
when He did send help at that time, and I saw that it was only for the
trial of our faith, and not because He had forsaken the work, that we
were brought so low, my soul was so strengthened and encouraged that I
have not only not been allowed to distrust the Lord since that time, but
I have not even been cast down when in the deepest poverty."

THE teacher must also be a learner, and therefore only he who continues
to learn is competent to continue to teach. Nothing but new lessons,
daily mastered, can keep our testimony fresh and vitalizing and enable
us to give advance lessons. Instead of being always engaged in a sort of
review, our teaching and testimony will thus be drawn each day from a
new and higher level.

George Müller''s experiences of prevailing prayer went on constantly
accumulating, and so qualified him to speak to others, not as on a
matter of speculation, theory, or doctrinal belief, but of long, varied,
and successful personal experiment. Patiently, carefully and frequently,
he seeks to impress on others the conditions of effective supplication.
From time to time he met those to whom his courageous, childlike trust
in God was a mystery; and occasionally unbelief''s secret misgivings
found a voice in the question, what he would do if God did not send
help! what, if a meal-time actually came with no food, and no money to
procure it; or if clothing were worn out, and nothing to replace it?

To all such questions there was always ready this one answer: that such
a failure on God''s part is inconceivable, and must therefore be put
among the impossibilities. There are, however, conditions necessary on
man''s part: the suppliant soul must come to God in the right spirit and
attitude. For the sake of such readers as might need further guidance
as to the proper and acceptable manner of approach to God, he was wont
to make very plain the scripture teaching upon this point.

1. Entire dependence upon the merits and mediation of the Lord Jesus
Christ, as the only ground of any claim for blessing. (See John xiv. 13,
14; xv. 16, etc.)

2. Separation from all known sin. If we regard iniquity in our hearts,
the Lord will not hear us, for it would be sanctioning sin. (Psalm lxvi.
18.)

3. Faith in God''s word of promise as confirmed by His oath. Not to
believe Him is to make Him both a liar and a perjurer. (Hebrews xi. 6;
vi. 13-20.)

4. Asking in accordance with His will. Our motives must be godly: we
must not seek any gift of God to consume it upon our own lusts. (1 John
v. 14; James iv. 3.)

5. Importunity in supplication. There must be waiting on God and waiting
for God, as the husbandman has long patience to wait for the harvest.
(James v. 7; Luke xviii. 1-10.)

The importance of firmly fixing in mind principles such as these cannot
be overstated. The first lays the basis of all prayer, in our oneness
with the great High Priest. The second states a condition of prayer,
found in abandonment of sin. The third reminds us of the need of
honouring God by faith that He is, and is the Rewarder of the diligent
seeker. The fourth reveals the sympathy with God that helps us to ask
what is for our good and His glory. The last teaches us that, having
laid hold of God in prayer, we are to keep hold until His arm is
outstretched in blessing.

Where these conditions do not exist, for God to answer prayer would be
both a dishonour to Himself and a damage to the suppliant. To encourage
those who come to Him in their own name, or in a self-righteous,
self-seeking, and disobedient spirit, would be to set a premium upon
continuance in sin. To answer the requests of the unbelieving would be
to disregard the double insult put upon His word of promise and His oath
of confirmation, by persistent doubt of His truthfulness and distrust of
His faithfulness. Indeed not one condition of prevailing prayer exists
which is not such in the very nature of things. These are not arbitrary
limitations affixed to prayer by a despotic will; they are necessary
alike to God''s character and man''s good.

All the lessons learned in God''s school of prayer made Mr. Müller''s
feelings and convictions about this matter more profound and subduing.
He saw the vital relation of prayer to holiness, and perpetually sought
to impress it upon both his hearers and readers; and, remembering that
for the purpose of persuasion the most effective figure of speech is
repetition, he hesitated at no frequency of restatement by which such
truths might find root in the minds and hearts of others.

There has never been a saint, from Abel''s day to our own, who has not
been taught the same essential lessons. All prayer which has ever
brought down blessing has prevailed by the same law of success—the
inward impulse of God''s Holy Spirit. If, therefore, that Spirit''s
teachings be disregarded or disobeyed, or His inward movings be
hindered, in just such measure will prayer become formal or be
altogether abandoned. Sin, consciously indulged, or duty, knowingly
neglected, makes supplication an offence to God.

Again, all prayer prevails only in the measure of our real, even if not
conscious, unity with the Lord Jesus Christ as the ground of our
approach, and in the degree of our dependence on Him as the medium of
our access to God.

Yet again, all prayer prevails only as it is offered in faith; and the
answer to such prayer can be recognized and received only on the
plane of faith; that is, we must maintain the believing frame,
expecting the blessing, and being ready to receive it in God''s way and
time and form, and not our own.

The faith that thus expects cannot be surprised at answers to prayer.
When, in November, 1840, a sister gave ten pounds for the orphans, and
at a time specially opportune, Mr. Müller records his triumphant joy in
God as exceeding and defying all expression. Yet he was free from
excitement and not in the least surprised, because by grace he had been
trustfully waiting on God for deliverance. Help had been so long delayed
that in one of the houses there was no bread, and in none of them any
milk or any money to buy either. It was only a few minutes before the
milkman''s cart was due, that this money came.

However faithful and trustful in prayer, it behooves us to be none the
less careful and diligent in the use of all proper means. Here again Mr.
Müller''s whole life is a lesson to other believers. For example, when
travelling in other lands, or helping other brethren on their way, he
besought the Lord''s constant guardianship over the conveyances used, and
even over the luggage so liable to go astray. But he himself looked
carefully to the seaworthiness of the vessel he was to sail in, and to
every other condition of safe and speedy transportation for himself and
others. In one case where certain German brethren and sisters were
departing for foreign shores, he noticed the manner in which the cabman
stored away the small luggage in the fly; and observed that several
carpetbags were hastily thrust into a hind boot. He also carefully
counted the pieces of luggage and took note of the fact that there were
seventeen in all. On arriving at the wharf, where there is generally
much hurry and flurry, the dishonest cabman would have driven off with a
large part of the property belonging to the party, but for this man of
God who not only prayed but watched. He who trusted God implicitly,
no less faithfully looked to the cabman''s fidelity, who, after he
pretended to have delivered all the luggage to the porters, was
compelled to open that hind boot and, greatly to his own confusion,
deliver up the five or six bags hidden away there. Mr. Müller adds in
his Narrative that "such a circumstance should teach one to make the
very smallest affairs a subject of prayer, as, for instance, that all
the luggage might be safely taken out of a fly." May we not add that
such a circumstance teaches us that companion lesson, quite as important
in its way, that we are to be watchful as well as prayerful, and see
that a dishonest cab-driver does not run off with another''s goods!

This praying saint, who watched man, most of all watched God. Even in
the lesser details of his work, his eye was ever looking for God''s
unfailing supplies, and taking notice of the divine leadings and
dealings; and, afterward, there always followed the fruit of the lips,
giving thanks to His name. Here is another secret revealed:
prayerfulness and thankfulness—those two handmaidens Of God—always go
together, each helping the other. "Pray without ceasing: in everything
give thanks." (1 Thess. v. 17, 18.) These two precepts stand side by
side where they belong, and he who neglects one will find himself
disobeying the other. This man who prayed so much and so well, offered
the sacrifice of praise to God continually.

For example, on September 21, 1840, a specific entry was made in the
Narrative, so simple, childlike, and in every way characteristic, that
every word of it is precious.

"The Lord, to show His continued care over us, raises up new helpers.
They that trust in the Lord shall never be confounded. Some who helped
for a while may fall asleep in Jesus; others grow cold in the service of
the Lord; others be as desirous as ever to help, but no longer able; or,
having means, feel it to be His will to lay them out in another way. But
in leaning upon God, the Living God alone, we are BEYOND DISAPPOINTMENT
and BEYOND being forsaken because of death, or want of means, or want
of love, or because of the claims of other work. How precious to have
learned, in any measure, to be content to stand with God alone in the
world, and to know that surely no good thing shall be withheld from us,
whilst we walk uprightly!"

Among the gifts received during this long life of stewardship for God
some deserve individual mention.

To an offering received in March, 1839, a peculiar history attaches. The
circumstances attending its reception made upon him a deep impression.
He had given a copy of the Annual Report to a believing brother who had
been greatly stirred up to prayer by reading it; and knowing his own
sister, who was also a disciple, to possess sundry costly ornaments and
jewels, such as a heavy gold chain, a pair of gold bracelets, and a
superb ring set with fine brilliants, this brother besought the Lord so
to show her the uselessness of such trinkets that she should be led to
lay them all upon His altar as an offering for the orphan work. This
prayer was literally answered. Her sacrifice of jewels proved of service
to the work at a time of such pressing need that Mr. Müller''s heart
specially rejoiced in God. By the proceeds of the sale of these
ornaments he was helped to meet the expenses of a whole week, and
besides to pay the salaries due to the helpers. But, before disposing
of the diamond ring, he wrote with it upon the window-pane of his own
room that precious name and title of the Lord—"JEHOVAH JIREH"—and
henceforth whenever, in deep poverty, he cast his eyes upon those two
words, imperishably written with the point of a diamond upon that pane,
he thankfully remembered that "THE LORD WILL PROVIDE."

How many of his fellow believers might find unfailing refreshment and
inspiration in dwelling upon the divine promises! Ancient believers were
bidden to write God''s words on the palms of their hands, the doorposts
of their houses, and on their gates, so that the employments of their
hands, their goings out and comings in, their personal and home life,
might be constant reminders of Jehovah''s everlasting faithfulness. He
who inscribed this chosen name of God upon the window-pane of his
dwelling, found that every ray of sunlight that shone into his room lit
up his Lord''s promise.

2. Instead of being disappointed in his expectations or work, the
reverse had been true, such trials being seen to be needful to
demonstrate that the Lord was their Helper in times of need.

3. Such a way of living brings the Lord very near, as one who daily
inspects the need that He may send the more timely aid.

4. Such constant, instant reliance upon divine help does not so absorb
the mind in temporal things as to unfit for spiritual employments and
enjoyments; but rather prompts to habitual communion with the Lord and
His Word.

5. Other children of God may not be called to a similar work, but are
called to a like faith, and may experience similar interposition if they
live according to His will and seek His help.

6. The incurring of debt, being unscriptural, is a sin needing
confession and abandonment if we desire unhindered fellowship with God,
and experience of His interposition.

It was in this year 1840, also, that a further object was embraced in
the work of the Scripture Knowledge Institution, namely, the circulation
of Christian books and tracts. But, as the continuance and enlargement
of these benevolent activities made the needs greater, so, in answer to
prayer, the Hand of the great Provider bestowed larger supplies.

Divine interposition will never be doubted by one who, like George
Müller, gives himself to prayer, for the coincidences will prove too
exact and frequent between demand and supply, times and seasons of
asking and answering, to allow of doubt that God has helped.

The ''ethics of language'' embody many lessons. For example, the term
''poetic retribution'' describes a visitation of judgment where the
penalty peculiarly befits the crime. As poetic lines harmonize, rhyme
and rhythm showing the work of a designing hand, so there is often
harmony between an offense and its retribution, as when Adonibezek, who
had afflicted a like injury upon threescore and five captive kings, had
his own thumbs and great toes cut off, or as when Haman was himself hung
on the gallows that he built for Mordecai. We read in Psalm ix. 16:

"The Lord is known by the judgment which He executeth:
        The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands."

The inspired thought is that the punishment of evil-doers is in such
exact correspondence with the character of their evil doings as to show
that it is the Lord executing vengeance—the penalty shows a designing
hand. He who watches the peculiar retributive judgments of God, how He
causes those who set snares and pitfalls for others to fall into them
themselves, will not doubt that behind such ''poetic retribution'' there
is an intelligent Judge.

Somewhat so the poetic harmony between prayer and its answer silences
all question as to a discriminating Hearer of the suppliant soul. A
single case of such answered prayer might be accounted accidental; but,
ever since men began to call upon the name of the Lord, there have been
such repeated, striking, and marvelous correspondences between the
requests of man and the replies of God, that the inference is perfectly
safe, the induction has too broad a basis and too large a body of
particulars to allow mistake. The coincidences are both too many and too
exact to admit the doctrine of chance. We are compelled, not to say
justified, to conclude that the only sufficient and reasonable
explanation must be found in a God who hears and answers prayer.

Mr. Müller was not the only party to these transactions, nor the only
person thus convinced that God was in the whole matter of the work and
its support. The donors as well as the receiver were conscious of
divine leading.

Frequent were the instances also when those who gave most timely help
conveyed to Mr. Müller the knowledge of the experiences that accompanied
or preceded their offerings; as, for example, when, without any
intimation being given them from man that there was special need, the
heart was impressed in prayer to God that there was an emergency
requiring prompt assistance.

For example, in June, 1841, fifty pounds were received with these words:
"I am not concerned at my having been prevented for so many days from
sending this money; I am confident it has not been needed."

"This last sentence is remarkable," says Mr. Müller. "It is now nearly
three years since our funds were for the first time exhausted, and only
at this period, since then, could it have been said in truth, so far as
I remember, that a donation of fifty pounds was not needed. From the
beginning in July, 1838, till now, there never had been a period when we
so abounded as when this donation came; for there were then, in the
orphan fund and the other funds, between two and three hundred pounds!
The words of our brother are so much the more remarkable as, on four
former occasions, when he likewise gave considerable donations, we were
always in need, yea, great need, which he afterwards knew from the
printed accounts."

Prevailing prayer is largely conditioned on constant obedience.
"Whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments,
and do those things which are well pleasing in His sight." (1 John iii.
22.) There is no way of keeping in close touch with God unless a new
step is taken in advance whenever new light is given. Here is another
of the life-secrets of George Müller. Without unduly counting the cost,
he followed every leading of God.

In July, 1841, both Mr. Craik and Mr. Müller were impressed that the
existing mode of receiving free-will offerings from those among whom
they laboured was inexpedient. These contributions were deposited in
boxes, over which their names were placed with an explanation of the
purpose to which such offerings were applied. But it was felt that this
might have the appearance of unduly elevating them above others, as
though they were assuming official importance, or excluding others from
full and equal recognition as labourers in word and doctrine. They
therefore decided to discontinue this mode of receiving such offerings.

Such an act of obedience may seem to some, over-scrupulous, but it cost
some inward struggles, for it threatened a possible and probable
decrease in supplies for their own needs, and the question naturally
arose how such lack should be supplied. Happily Mr. Müller had long ago
settled the question that to follow a clear sense of duty is always
safe. He could say, in every such crisis, "O God, my heart is fixed, my
heart is fixed, trusting in Thee." (Psalm cxii. 7.) Once for all having
made such a decision, such apparent risks did not for a moment disturb
his peace. Somehow or other the Lord would provide, and all he had to do
was to serve and trust Him and leave the rest to His Fatherhood.

In the autumn of 1841 it pleased God that, beyond any previous period,
there should be a severe test of faith. For some months the supplies had
been comparatively abundant, but now, from day to day and from meal to
meal, the eye of faith had to be turned to the Lord, and,
notwithstanding continuance in prayer, help seemed at times to fail,
so much so that it was a special sign of God''s grace that, during this
long trial of delay, the confidence of Mr. Müller and his helpers did
not altogether give way. But he and they were held up, and he
unwaveringly rested on the fatherly pity of God.

On one occasion a poor woman gave two pence, adding, "It is but a
trifle, but I must give it to you." Yet so opportune was the gift of
these ''two mites'' that one of these two pence was just what was at
that time needed to make up the sum required to buy bread for immediate
use. At another time eight pence more being necessary to provide for the
next meal, but seven pence were in hand; but on opening one of the
boxes, one penny only was found deposited, and thus a single penny was
traced to the Father''s care.

It was in December of this same year, 1841, that, in order to show how
solely dependence was placed on a heavenly Provider, it was determined
to delay for a while both the holding of any public meeting and the
printing of the Annual Report. Mr. Müller was confident that, though no
word should be either spoken or printed about the work and its needs,
the means would still be supplied. As a matter of fact the report of
1841-2 was thus postponed for five months; and so, in the midst of deep
poverty and partly because of the very pressure of such need, another
bold step was taken, which, like the cutting away of the ropes that held
the life-boat, in that Mediterranean shipwreck, threw Mr. Müller, and
all that were with him in the work, more completely on the promise and
the providence of God.

It might be inferred that, where such a decision was made, the Lord
would make haste to reward at once such courageous confidence. And yet,
so mysterious are His ways, that never, up to that time, had Mr.
Müller''s faith been tried so sharply as between December 12, 1841, and
April 12, 1842. During these four months, again, it was as though God
were saying, "I will now see whether indeed you truly lean on Me and
look to Me." At any time during this trial, Mr. Müller might have
changed his course, holding the public meeting and publishing the
report, for, outside the few who were in his councils, no one knew of
the determination, and in fact many children of God, looking for the
usual year''s journal of ''The Lord''s Dealings,'' were surprised at the
delay. But the conclusion conscientiously reached was, for the glory of
the Lord, as steadfastly pursued, and again Jehovah Jireh revealed His
faithfulness.

During this four months, on March 9, 1842, the need was so extreme that,
had no help come, the work could not have gone on. But, on that day,
from a brother living near Dublin, ten pounds came: and the hand of the
Lord clearly appeared in this gift, for when the post had already come
and no letter had come with it, there was a strong confidence suggested
to Mr. Müller''s mind that deliverance was at hand; and so it proved, for
presently the letter was brought to him, having been delivered at one of
the other houses. During this same month, it was necessary once to
delay dinner for about a half-hour, because of a lack of supplies.
Such a postponement had scarcely ever been known before, and very rarely
was it repeated in the entire after-history of the work, though
thousands of mouths had to be daily fed.

In the spring of 1843, Mr. Müller felt led to open a fourth orphan
house, the third having been opened nearly six years before. This step
was taken with his uniform conscientiousness, deliberation, and
prayerfulness. He had seen many reasons for such enlargement of the
work, but he had said nothing about the matter even to his beloved wife.
Day by day he waited on God in prayer, preferring to take counsel only
of Him, lest he might do something in haste, move in advance of clear
leading, or be biassed unduly by human judgment.

Unexpected obstacles interfered with his securing the premises which had
already been offered and found suitable; but he was in no way
''discomforted.'' The burden of his prayer was, "Lord, if Thou hast no
need of another orphan house, I have none"; and he rightly judged that
the calm deliberation with which he had set about the whole matter, and
the unbroken peace with which he met new hindrances, were proofs that he
was following the guidance of God and not the motions of self-will.

As the public meeting and the publication of the Annual Report had been
purposely postponed to show that no undue dependence was placed even on
indirect appeals to man, much special prayer went up to God, that,
before July 15, 1844, when the public meeting was to be held, He would
so richly supply all need that it might clearly appear that,
notwithstanding these lawful means of informing His servants concerning
the work had for a time not been used, the prayer of faith had drawn
down help from above. As the financial year had closed in May, it would
be more than two years since the previous report had been made to the
public.

George Müller was jealous for the Lord God of hosts, He desired that
"even the shadow of ground might be cut off for persons to say, ''They
cannot get any more money; and therefore they now publish another
report.''" Hence, while, during the whole progress of the work, he
desired to stand with his Master, without heeding either the favourable
or unfavourable judgments of men, he felt strongly that God would be
much honoured and glorified as the prayer-hearing God if, before the
public had been at all apprised of the situation, an ample supply might
be given. In such case, instead of appearing to ask aid of men, he and
his associates would be able to witness to the church and the world,
God''s faithfulness, and offer Him the praise of joyful and thankful
hearts. As he had asked, so was it done unto him. Money and other
supplies came in, and, on the day before the accounts were closed, such
liberal gifts, that there was a surplus of over twenty pounds for the
whole work.

"THE steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." (Psalm xxxvii. 23.)
Some one quaintly adds, "Yes, and the stops, too!" The pillar of cloud
and fire is a symbol of that divine leadership which guides both as to
forward steps and intervals of rest. Mr Müller found it blessed to
follow, one step at a time, as God ordered his way, and to stand still
and wait when He seemed to call for a halt.

At the end of May, 1843, a crisis was reached, which was a new example
of the experiences to which faith is liable in the walk with God; and a
new illustration of the duty and delight of depending upon Him in
everything and for everything, habitually waiting upon Him, and trusting
in Him to remove all hindrances in the way of service.

Some eighteen months previously, a German lady from Wurtemberg had
called to consult him as to her own plans, and, finding her a
comparative stranger to God, he spoke to her about her spiritual state,
and gave her the first two parts of his Narrative. The perusal of these
pages was so blest to her that she was converted to God, and felt moved
to translate the Narrative into her own tongue as a channel of similar
blessing to other hearts.

This work of translation she partially accomplished, though somewhat
imperfectly; and the whole occurrence impressed Mr. Müller as an
indication that God was once more leading him in the direction of
Germany, for another season of labour in his native land. Much prayer
deepened his persuasion that he had not misread God''s signal, and that
His time had now fully come. He records some of the motives which led to
this conclusion.

1. First, he yearned to encourage believing brethren who for conscience''
sake had felt constrained to separate themselves from the state
churches, and meet for worship in such conditions as would more accord
with New Testament principles, and secure greater edification.

2. Being a German himself, and therefore familiar with their language,
customs, and habits of thought, he saw that he was fitted to wield a
larger influence among his fellow countrymen than otherwise.

3. He was minded to publish his Narrative in his own tongue wherein he
was born, not so much in the form of a mere translation, as of an
independent record of his life''s experiences such as would be specially
suited to its new mission.

4. An effectual door was opened before him, and more widely than ever,
especially at Stuttgart; and although there were many adversaries, they
only made his help the more needful to those whose spiritual welfare was
in peril.

5. A distinct burden was laid on his heart, as from the Lord, which
prayer, instead of relieving, increased—a burden which he felt
without being able to explain—so that the determination to visit his
native land gave him a certain peace which he did not have when he
thought of remaining at home.

1. The new orphan house, No. 4, was about to be opened, and his presence
was desirable if not needful.

2. A few hundred pounds were needed, to be left with his helpers, for
current expenses in his absence.

3. Money was also required for travelling expenses of himself and his
wife, whose health called for a change.

4. Funds would be needful to publish four thousand copies of his
Narrative and avoid too high a market-price.

In this careful weighing of matters many sincere disciples fail, prone
to be impatient of delay in making decisions. Impulse too often sways,
and self-willed plans betray into false and even disastrous mistakes.
Life is too precious to risk one such failure. There is given us a
promise of deep meaning:

"The meek will He guide in judgment;
        And the meek will He teach His way."
              (Psalm xxv. 9.)

Here is a double emphasis upon meekness as a condition of such
guidance and teaching. Meekness is a real preference for God''s will.
Where this holy habit of mind exists, the whole being becomes so open to
impression that, without any outward sign or token, there is an
inward recognition and choice of the will of God. God guides, not by a
visible sign, but by swaying the judgment. To wait before Him,
weighing candidly in the scales every consideration for or against a
proposed course, and in readiness to see which way the preponderance
lies, is a frame of mind and heart in which one is fitted to be guided;
and God touches the scales and makes the balance to sway as He will.
But our hands must be off the scales, otherwise we need expect no
interposition of His, in our favour. To return to the figure with which
this chapter starts, the meek soul simply and humbly waits, and watches
the moving of the Pillar.

One sure sign of this spirit of meekness is the entire restfulness
with which apparent obstacles to any proposed plan or course are
regarded. When waiting and wishing only to know and do God''s will,
hindrances will give no anxiety, but a sort of pleasure, as affording a
new opportunity for divine interposition. If it is the Pillar of God we
are following, the Red Sea will not dismay us, for it will furnish but
another scene for the display of the power of Him who can make the
waters to stand up as an heap, and to become a wall about us as we go
through the sea on dry ground.

Mr. Müller had learned this rare lesson, and in this case he says: "I
had a secret satisfaction in the greatness of the difficulties which
were in the way. So far from being cast down on account of them, they
delighted my soul; for I only desired to do the will of the Lord in this
matter."

Here is revealed another secret of holy serving. To him who sets the
Lord always before him, and to whom the will of God is his delight,
there pertains a habit of soul which, in advance settles a thousand
difficult and perplexing questions.

The case in hand is an illustration of the blessing found in such meek
preference for God''s pleasure. If it were the will of the Lord that this
Continental tour should be undertaken at that time, difficulties need
not cast him down; for the difficulties could not be of God; and, if
not of God, they should give him no unrest, for, in answer to prayer,
they would all be removed. If, on the other hand, this proposed visit to
the Continent were not God''s plan at all, but only the fruit of
self-will; if some secret, selfish, and perhaps subtle motive were
controlling, then indeed hindrances might well be interferences of God,
designed to stay his steps. In the latter case, Mr. Müller rightly
judged that difficulties in the way would naturally vex and annoy him;
that he would not like to look at them, and would seek to remove them by
his own efforts. Instead of giving him an inward satisfaction as
affording God an opportunity to intervene in his behalf, they would
arouse impatience and vexation, as preventing self-will from carrying
out its own purposes.

Such discriminations have only to be stated to any spiritual mind, to
have their wisdom at once apparent. Any believing child of God may
safely gauge the measure of his surrender to the will of God, in any
matter, by the measure of impatience he feels at the obstacles in the
way; for in proportion as self-will sways him, whatever seems to oppose
or hinder his plans will disturb or annoy; and, instead of quietly
leaving all such hindrances and obstacles to the Lord, to deal with them
as He pleases, in His own way and time, the wilful disciple will,
impatiently and in the energy of the flesh, set himself to remove them
by his own scheming and struggling, and he will brook no delay.

Whenever Satan acts as a hinderer (1 Thess. ii. 18) the obstacles which
he puts in our way need not dismay us; God permits them to delay or
deter us for the time, only as a test of our patience and faith, and the
satanic hinderer will be met by a divine Helper who will sweep away all
his obstacles, as with the breath of His mouth.

Mr. Müller felt this, and he waited on God for light and help. But,
after forty days'' waiting, the hindrances, instead of decreasing, seemed
rather to increase. Much more money was spent than was sent in; instead
of finding another suitable matron, a sister, already at work, was
probably about to withdraw, so that two vacancies would need to be
filled instead of one. Yet his rest and peace of mind were unbroken.
Being persuaded that he was yielded up to the will of God, faith not
only held him to his purpose, but saw the obstacles already surmounted,
so that he gave thanks in advance. Because Caleb "followed the Lord
fully," even the giant sons of Anak with their walled cities and
chariots of iron had for him no terrors. Their defence was departed from
them, but the Lord was with His believing follower, and made him strong
to drive them out and take possession of their very stronghold as his
own inheritance.

During this period of patient waiting, Mr. Müller remarked to a
believing sister: "Well, my soul is at peace. The Lord''s time is not yet
come; but, when it is come, He will blow away all these obstacles, as
chaff is blown away before the wind." A quarter of an hour later, a
gift of seven hundred pounds became available for the ends in view, so
that three of the five hindrances to this Continental tour were at once
removed. All travelling expenses for himself and wife, all necessary
funds for the home work for two months in advance, and all costs of
publishing the Narrative in German, were now provided. This was on July
12th; and so soon afterward were the remaining impediments out of the
way that, by August 9th, Mr. and Mrs. Müller were off for Germany.

The trip covered but seven months: and on March 6, 1844, they were once
more in Bristol. During this sojourn abroad no journal was kept, but Mr.
Müller''s letters serve the purpose of a record. Rotterdam, Weinheim,
Cologne, Mayence, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, etc., were visited, and Mr.
Müller distributed tracts and conversed with individuals by the way; but
his main work was to expound the Word in little assemblies of believers,
who had separated themselves from the state church on account of what
they deemed errors in teaching, practice, modes of worship, etc.

The first hour of his stay at Stuttgart brought to him one of the
sharpest trials of faith he had ever thus far experienced. The nature of
it he does not reveal in his journal, but it now transpires that it was
due to the recalling of the seven hundred pounds, the gift of which had
led to his going to Germany. This fact could not at the time be recorded
because the party would feel it a reproach. Nor was this the only test
of faith during his sojourn abroad; in fact so many, so great, so
varied, and so prolonged were some of these trials, as to call into full
exercise all the wisdom and grace which he had received from God, and
whatever lessons he had previously learned in the school of experience
became now of use. Yet not only was his peace undisturbed, but he bears
witness that the conviction so rooted itself in his inmost being that in
all this God''s goodness was being shown, that he would have had nothing
different. The greatest trials bore fruit in the fullest blessings and
sometimes in clusters of blessings. It particularly moved him to adoring
wonder and praise to see God''s wisdom in having delayed his visit until
the very time when it occurred. Had he gone any earlier he would have
gone too soon, lacking the full experience necessary to confront the
perplexities of his work. When darkness seemed to obscure his way, faith
kept him expectant of light, or at least of guidance in the darkness;
and he found that promise to be literally fulfilled:

"As thou goest, step by step, the way shall open up before thee." (See
the Hebrew, of Prov. iv. 12.)

At Stuttgart he found and felt, like Jude, that it was "needful
earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints." Even
among believers, errors had found far too deep root. Especially was
undue stress laid upon baptism, which was made to occupy a prominence
and importance out of all due proportion of faith. One brother had been
teaching that without it there is no new birth, and that, consequently,
no one could, before baptism, claim the forgiveness of sins; that the
apostles were not born from above until the day of Pentecost, and that
our Lord Himself had not been new-born until His own baptism, and had
thence, for the rest of His mortal life, ceased to be under the law!
Many other fanciful notions were found to prevail, such as that baptism
is the actual death of the old man by drowning, and that it is a
covenant with the believer into which God enters; that it is a sin to
break bread with unbaptized believers or with members of the state
church; and that the bread and the cup used in the Lord''s Supper not
only mean but are the very body and blood of the Lord, etc.

A more serious and dangerous doctrine which it was needful to confront
and confute was what Mr. Müller calls that "awful error," spread almost
universally among believers in that land, that at last "all will be
saved," not-sinful men only, but "even the devils themselves."

Calmly and courteously, but firmly and courageously, these and kindred
errors were met with the plain witness of the Word. Refutation of false
teaching aroused a spirit of bitterness in opposers of the truth, and,
as is too often the case, faithful testimony was the occasion of
acrimony; but the Lord stood by His servant and so strengthened him that
he was kept both faithful and peaceful.

One grave practical lack which Mr. Müller sought to remedy was ignorance
of those deeper truths of the Word, which relate to the power and
presence of the Holy Spirit of God in the church, and to the ministry of
saints, one to another, as fellow members in the body of Christ, and as
those to whom that same Spirit divides severally, as He will, spiritual
gifts for service. As a natural result of being untaught in these
important practical matters, believers'' meetings had proved rather
opportunities for unprofitable talk than godly edifying which is in
faith. The only hope of meeting such errors and supplying such lack lay
in faithful scripture teaching, and he undertook for a time to act as
the sole teacher in these gatherings, that the word of God might have
free course and be glorified. Afterward, when there seemed to be among
the brethren some proper apprehension of vital spiritual truths, with
his usual consistency and humility he resumed his place as simply a
brother among fellow believers, all of whom had liberty to teach as the
Spirit might lead and guide. There was, however, no shrinking from any
duty or responsibility laid upon him by larger, clearer acquaintance
with truth, or more complete experience of its power. When called by the
voice of his brethren to expound the Word in public assemblies, he
gladly embraced all opportunities for further instruction out of Holy
Scripture and of witness to God. With strong emphasis he dwelt upon the
presiding presence of the Blessed Spirit in all assemblies of saints,
and upon the duty and privilege of leaving the whole conduct of such
assemblies to His divine ordering; and in perfect accord, with such
teaching he showed that the Holy Spirit, if left free to administer all
things, would lead such brethren to speak, at such times and on such
themes as He mighty please; and that, whenever their desires and
preferences were spiritual and not carnal, such choice of the Spirit
would always be in harmony with their own.

These views of the Spirit''s administration in the assemblies of
believers, and of His manifestation in all believers for common profit,
fully accord with scripture teaching. (1 Cor. xii., Romans xii., Ephes.
iv., etc.) Were such views practically held in the church of this day, a
radical revolution would be wrought and a revival of apostolic faith and
primitive church life would inevitably follow. No one subject is perhaps
more misunderstood, or less understood, even among professed believers,
than the person, offices, and functions of the Spirit of God. John Owen,
long since, suggested that the practical test of soundness in the faith,
during the present gospel age, is the attitude of the church toward the
Holy Spirit. If so, the great apostasy cannot be far off, if indeed it
is not already upon us, for there is a shameful ignorance and
indifference prevalent, as to the whole matter of His claim to holy
reverence and obedience.

In connection with this visit to Germany, a curious misapprehension
existed, to which a religious periodical had given currency, that Mr.
Müller was deputed by the English Baptists to labour among German
Baptists to bring them back to the state church. This rumour was of
course utterly unfounded, but he had no chance to correct it until just
before his return to Britain, as he had not until then heard of it. The
Lord had allowed this false report to spread and had used it to serve
His own ends, for it was due in part to this wrong impression of Mr.
Müller''s mission that he was not molested or interfered with by the
officers of the government. Though for months openly and undisguisedly
teaching vital gospel truths among believers who had separated from the
established church, he had suffered no restraint, for, so long as it was
thought that his mission in Germany was to reclaim to the fold of the
state church those who had wandered away, he would of course be liable
to no interference from state officials.

The Lord went before His servant also in preparing the way for the
publishing of his Narrative, guiding him to a bookseller who undertook
its sale on commission, enabling the author to retain two thousand
copies to give away, while the rest were left to be sold.

Mr. Müller, about this time, makes special mention of his joy and
comfort in the spiritual blessing attending his work, and the present
and visible good, wrought through the publication of his Narrative. Many
believers had been led to put more faith in the promises of the great
Provider, and unbelievers had been converted by their perusal of the
simple story of the Lord''s dealings; and these tidings came from every
quarter where the Narrative had as yet found its way.

The name of Henry Craik, hitherto affixed to every report together with
George Müller''s, appears for the last time in the Report of 1844. This
withdrawal of his name resulted, not from any division of feeling or
diminution of sympathy, but solely from Mr. Craik''s conviction that the
honour of being used of God as His instrument in forwarding the great
work of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution belonged solely to George
Müller.

The trials of faith ceased not although the occasions of praise were so
multiplied. On September 4, 1844, day-dawn, but one farthing was left on
hand, and hundred and forty mouths were to be fed at breakfast!''

The lack of money and such supplies was, however, only one form of these
tests of faith and incentives to prayer. Indeed he accounted these the
lightest of his burdens, for there were other cares and anxieties that
called for greater exercise of faith resolutely to cast them on Him who,
in exchange for solicitude, gives His own perfect peace. What these
trials were, any thoughtful mind must at once see who remembers how
these many orphans were needing, not only daily supplies of food and
clothing, but education, in mind and in morals; preparation for, and
location in, suitable homes; careful guards about their health and every
possible precaution and provision to prevent disease; also the character
of all helpers must be carefully investigated before they were admitted,
and their conduct carefully watched afterward lest any unworthy or
unqualified party should find a place, or be retained, in the conduct of
the work.

These and other matters, too many to be individually mentioned, had to
be borne daily to the great Helper, without whose Everlasting Arms they
could not have been carried. And Mr. Müller seeks constantly to impress
on all who read his pages or heard his voice, the perfect
trustworthiness of God. For any and all needs of the work help was
always given, and it never once came too late. However poor, and
however long the suppliant believer waits on God, he never fails to get
help, if he trusts the promises and is in the path of duty. Even the
delay in answered prayer serves a purpose. God permits us to call on Him
while He answers not a word, both to test our faith and importunity, and
to encourage others who hear of His dealings with us.

And so it was that, whether there were on hand much or little, by God''s
grace the founder of these institutions remained untroubled, confident
that deliverance would surely come in the best way and time, not only
with reference to temporal wants, but in all things needful.

During the history of the Institution thus far, enlargement had been its
law. Mr. Müller''s heart grew in capacity for larger service, and his
faith in capacity for firmer confidence, so that while he was led to
attempt greater things for God, he was led also to expect greater things
from God. Those suggestive words of Christ to Nathanael have often
prompted like larger expectations: "Believest thou? thou shalt see
greater things than these." (John i. 50.)

In the year 1846, the wants of the mission field took far deeper hold
of him than ever before. He had already been giving aid to brethren
abroad, in British Guiana and elsewhere, as well as in fields nearer at
home. But he felt a strong yearning to be used of God more largely in
sending to their fields and supporting in their labours, the chosen
servants of the Lord who were working on a scriptural basis and were in
need of help. He had observed that whenever God had put into his heart
to devise liberal things, He had put into his hand the means to carry
out such liberal purposes; and from this time forth he determined, as
far as God should enable him, to aid brethren of good report, labouring
in word and doctrine, throughout the United Kingdom, who were faithful
witnesses to God and were receiving no regular salary. The special
object he had in view was to give a helping hand to such as for the sake
of conscience and of Christ had relinquished former stipends or worldly
emoluments.

Whatever enlargement took place in the work, however, it was no sign of
surplus funds. Every department of service or new call of duty had
separate and prayerful consideration. Advance steps were taken only when
and where and so fast as the Pillar moved, and fresh work was often
undertaken at a time when there was a lack rather than an abundance of
money.

Some who heard of Mr. Müller''s absence in Germany inferred plenty of
funds on hand—a conclusion that was neither true nor legitimate. At
times when poverty was most pressing, additional expenditure was not
avoided nor new responsibility evaded if, after much prayer, the Lord
seemed plainly leading in that direction. And it was beautiful to see
how He did not permit any existing work to be embarrassed because at His
bidding new work was Undertaken.

One great law for all who would be truly led by God''s Pillar of cloud
and fire, is to take no step at the bidding of self-will or without the
clear moving of the heavenly Guide. Though the direction be new and the
way seem beset with difficulty, there is never any risk, provided we are
only led of God. Each new advance needs separate and special authority
from Him, and yesterday''s guidance is not sufficient for to-day.

It is important also to observe that, if one branch of the work is in
straits, it is not necessarily a reason for abandoning another form of
service. The work of God depends on Him alone. If the whole tree is His
planting, we need not cut off one limb to save another. The whole body
is His, and, if one member is weak, it is not necessary to cut off
another to make it strong, for the strength of the whole body is the
dependence of every part. In our many-branching service each must get
vitality and vigour from the same source in God. Nevertheless let us not
forget that the stops, as well as the steps, of a good man are
ordered of the Lord. If the work is His work, let Him control it, and,
whether we expand or contract, let it be at His bidding, and a matter of
equal satisfaction to His servant.

How complex are the movements of God''s providence! Some events are
themselves eventful. Like the wheels in Ezekiel''s vision—a wheel in the
middle of a wheel,—they involve other issues within their mysterious
mechanism, and constitute epochs of history. Such an epochal event was
the building of the first of the New Orphan Houses on Ashley Down.

After October, 1845, it became clear to Mr. Müller that the Lord was
leading in this direction. Residents on Wilson Street had raised
objections to the noise made by the children, especially in play hours;
the playgrounds were no longer large enough for so many orphans; the
drainage was not adequate, nor was the situation of the rented houses
favourable, for proper sanitary conditions; it was also desirable to
secure ground for cultivation, and thus supply outdoor work for the
boys, etc. Such were some of the reasons which seemed to demand the
building of a new orphan house; and the conviction steadily gained
ground that the highest well-being of all concerned would be largely
promoted if a suitable site could be found on which to erect a building
adapted to the purpose.

There were objections to building which were carefully weighed: money in
large sums would be needed; planning and constructing would severely tax
time and strength; wisdom and oversight would be in demand at every
stage of the work; and the question arose whether such permanent
structures befit God''s pilgrim people, who have here no continuing city
and believe that the end of all things is at hand.

Continuance in prayer, however, brought a sense of quiet and restful
conviction that all objections were overbalanced by other and favourable
considerations. One argument seemed particularly weighty: Should God
provide large amounts of money for this purpose, it would still further
illustrate the power of prayer, offered in faith, to command help from
on high. A lot of ground, spacious enough, would, at the outset, cost
thousands of pounds; but why should this daunt a true child of God whose
Father was infinitely rich? Mr. Müller and his helpers sought day by day
to be guided of God, and, as faith fed on this daily bread of contact
with Him, the assurance grew strong that help would come. Shortly Mr.
Müller was as sure of this as though the building already stood before
his eyes, though for five weeks not one penny had been sent in for this
purpose. Meanwhile there went on that searching scrutiny of his own
heart by which he sought to know whether any hidden motive of a selfish
sort was swaying his will; but as strict self-examination brought to
light no conscious purpose but to glorify God, in promoting the good of
the orphans, and provoking to larger trust in God all who witnessed the
work, it was judged to be God''s will that he should go forward.

In November of this year, he was much encouraged by a visit from a
believing brother* who bade him go on in the work, but wisely impressed
on him the need of asking for wisdom from above, at every step, seeking
God''s help in showing him the plan for the building, that all details
might accord with the divine mind. On the thirty-sixth day after
specific prayer had first been offered about this new house, on December
10, 1845, Mr. Müller received one thousand pounds for this purpose,
the largest sum yet received in one donation since the work had begun,
March 5, 1834. Yet he was as calm and composed as though the gift had
been only a shilling; having full faith in God, as both guiding and
providing, he records that he would not have been surprised had the
amount been five or ten times greater.

* Robert C. Chapman, of Barnstaple, yet living—and whom Mr. Müller
cherished as his "oldest friend."

Three days later, a Christian architect in London voluntarily offered
not only to draught the plans, but gratuitously to superintend the
building! This offer had been brought about in a manner so strange as to
be naturally regarded as a new sign and proof of God''s approval and a
fresh pledge of His sure help. Mr. Müller''s sister-in-law, visiting the
metropolis, had met this architect; and, finding him much interested to
know more of the work of which he had read in the narrative, she had
told him of the purpose to build; whereupon, without either solicitation
or expectation on her part, this cheerful offer was made. Not only was
this architect not urged by her, but he pressed his proposal, himself,
urged on by his deep interest in the orphan work. Thus, within forty
days, the first thousand pounds had been given in answer to prayer, and
a pious man, as yet unseen and unknown by Mr. Müller, had been led to
offer his services in providing plans for the new building and
superintending its erection. Surely God was moving before His servant.

For a man, personally penniless, to attempt to erect such a house, on
such a scale, without appeal to man and in sole dependence on God was no
small venture of faith.

The full risk involved in such an undertaking, and the full force of the
testimony which it has since afforded to a prayer-hearing God, can be
felt only as the full weight of the responsibility is appreciated and
all the circumstances are duly considered.

First of all, ground must be bought, and it must comprise six or seven
acres, and the site must be in or near Bristol; for Mr. Müller''s general
sphere of work was in the city, the orphans and their helpers should be
within reasonable reach of their customary meeting-place, and on many
other accounts such nearness to the city was desirable. But such a site
would cost from two thousand to three thousand pounds.

Next the building must be constructed, fitted up, and furnished, with
accommodations for three hundred orphans and their overseers, teachers,
and various helpers. However plain the building and its furnishings, the
total cost would reach from three to four times the price of the site.

Then, the annual cost of keeping such house open and of maintaining such
a large body of inmates would be four or five thousand pounds more.

Here, then, was a prospective outlay of somewhere between ten thousand
and fifteen thousand pounds, for site and building, with a further
expense of one third as much more every year. No man so poor as George
Müller, if at the same time sane, would ever have thought of such a
gigantic scheme, much less have undertaken to work it out, if his faith
and hope were not fixed on God. Mr. Müller himself confesses that here
lay his whole secret. He was not driven onward by any self-seeking, but
drawn onward by a conviction that he was doing the will of God. When
Constantine was laying out on a vast scale the new capital on the
Bosphorus, he met the misgivings of those about him who wondered at his
audacity, by simply saying, "I am following One who is leading me."
George Müller''s scheme was not self-originated. He followed One who was
leading him; and, because confident and conscious of such guidance, he
had only to follow, trust, and wait.

In proportion as the undertaking was great, he desired God''s hand to be
very clearly seen. Hence he forbore even to seem prominent: he issued no
circular, announcing his purpose, and spoke of it only to the few who
were in his councils, and even then only as conversation led in that
direction. He remembered the promise, "I will guide thee with Mine eye,"
and looking up to God, he took no step unless the divine glance or beck
made duty "clear as daylight." As he saw the matter, his whole business
was to wait on God in prayer with faith and patience.

The assurance became doubly sure that God would build for Himself a
large orphan house near Bristol, to show to all, near and far, what a
blessed privilege it is to trust in Him. He desired God Himself so
manifestly to act as that he should be seen by all men to be nothing but
His instrument, passive in His hands. Meanwhile he went on with his
daily search into the Word, where he found instruction so rich, and
encouragement so timely, that the Scriptures seemed written for his
special use—to convey messages to him from above. For example, in the
opening of the Book of Ezra, he saw how God, when His time had fully
come for the return of His exiled people to their own land and for the
rebuilding of His Temple, used Cyrus, an idolatrous king, to issue an
edict, and to provide means for carrying out His own unknown purpose. He
saw also how God stirred up the people to help the returning exiles in
their work; and he said to himself, this same God can and will, in His
own way, supply the money and all the needed help of man, stirring up
the hearts of His own children to aid as He may please.

The first donations toward the work themselves embody a suggestive
lesson. On December 10th, one thousand pounds had been given in one sum;
twenty days later, fifty pounds more; and the next day, three and
sixpence, followed, the same evening, by a second gift of a thousand
pounds. Shortly after, a little bag, made of foreign seeds, and a flower
wrought of shells, were sent to be sold for the fund; and, in connection
with these last gifts, of very little inherent value, a promise was
quoted, which had been prominently before the giver''s mind, and which
brought more encouragement to Mr. Müller than any mere sum of money:

"Who art thou, O great mountain?
        Before Zerubbabel, thou shalt become a plain!"
          (Zech. iv. 7.)

Gifts, however large, were never estimated by intrinsic worth, but as
tokens of God''s working in the minds of His people, and of His gracious
working with and through His servant; and, for this reason, a thousand
pounds caused no more sincere praise to God and no more excitement of
mind than the fourpence given subsequently by a poor orphan.

Specially asking the Lord to go before him, Mr. Müller now began to seek
a suitable site. About four weeks passed in seemingly fruitless
search, when he was strongly impressed that very soon the Lord would
give the ground, and he so told his helpers on the evening of Saturday,
January 31, 1846. Within two days, his mind was drawn to Ashley Down,
where he found lots singularly suited for his needs. Shortly after, he
called twice on the owner, once at his house and again at his office;
but on both occasions failing to find him, he only left a message. He
judged that God''s hand was to be seen even in his not finding the man
he sought, and that, having twice failed the same day, he was not to
push the matter as though self-willed, but patiently wait till the
morrow. When he did find the owner, his patience was unexpectedly
rewarded. He confessed that he had spent two wakeful hours in bed,
thinking about his land, and about what reply he should make to Mr.
Müller''s inquiry as to its sale for an orphan house; and that he had
determined, if it were applied for, to ask but one hundred and twenty
pounds an acre, instead of two hundred, his previous price.

The bargain was promptly completed; and thus the Lord''s servant, by not
being in a hurry, saved, in the purchase of the site of seven acres,
five hundred and sixty pounds! Mr. Müller had asked the Lord to go
before him, and He had done so in a sense he had not thought of, first
speaking about the matter to the owner, holding his eyes waking till He
had made clear to him, as His servant and steward, what He would have
him do in the sale of that property.*

Six days after, came the formal offer from the London architect of his
services in surveying, in draughting plans, elevations, sections, and
specifications, and in overseeing the work of construction; and a week
later he came to Bristol, saw the site, and pronounced it in all
respects well fitted for its purpose.

Up to June 4, 1846, the total sum in hand for the building was a little
more than twenty-seven hundred pounds, a small part only of the sum
needful; but Mr. Müller felt no doubt that in God''s own time all that
was required would be given. Two hundred and twelve days he had been
waiting on God for the way to be opened for building, and he resolved to
wait still further until the whole sum was in hand, using for the
purpose only such gifts as were specified or left free for that end. He
also wisely decided that others must henceforth share the burden, and
that he would look out ten brethren of honest report, full of the Holy
Ghost and of wisdom, to act as trustees to hold and administer this
property in God''s name. He felt that, as this work was now so enlarging,
and the foundations of a permanent Institution were to be laid, the
Christian public, who would aid in its erection and support, would be
entitled to a representation in its conduct. At such a point as this
many others have made a serious mistake, forfeiting confidence by
administering public benefactions in a private manner and an autocratic
spirit—their own head being the office, and their own pocket the
treasury, of a public and benevolent institution.

Satan again acted as a hinderer. After the ground for the new orphan
house had been found, bought and paid for, unforeseen obstacles
prevented prompt possession; but Mr. Müller''s peace was not disturbed,
knowing even hindrances to be under God''s control. If the Lord should
allow one piece of land to be taken from him, it would only be because
He was about to give him one still better; and so the delay only proved
his faith and perfected his patience.

On July 6th, two thousand pounds were given—twice as large a gift as
had yet come in one donation; and, on January 25, 1847, another like
offering, so that, on July 5th following, the work of building began.
Six months later, after four hundred days of waiting upon God for this
new orphan house, nine thousand pounds had been given in answer to
believing prayer.

As the new building approached completion, with its three hundred large
windows, and requiring full preparation for the accommodation of about
three hundred and thirty inmates, although above eleven thousand pounds
had been provided, several thousand more were necessary. But Mr. Müller
was not only helped, but far beyond his largest expectations. Up to May
26, 1848, these latter needs existed, and, had but one serious
difficulty remained unremoved, the result must have been failure. But
all the necessary money was obtained, and even more, and all the helpers
were provided for the oversight of the orphans. On June 18, 1849, more
than twelve years after the beginning of the work, the orphans began to
be transferred from the four rented houses on Wilson Street to the new
orphan house on Ashley Down. Five weeks passed before fresh applicants
were received, that everything about the new institution might first be
brought into complete order by some experience in its conduct. By May
26, 1850, however, there were in the house two hundred and seventy-five
children, and the whole number of inmates was three hundred and eight.

The name—"The New Orphan House" rather than "Asylum"—was chosen to
distinguish it from another institution, near by; and particularly was
it requested that it might never be known as "Mr. Müller''s Orphan
House," lest undue prominence be given to one who had been merely God''s
instrument in its erection. He esteemed it a sin to appropriate even
indirectly, or allow others to attribute to him, any part of the glory
which belonged solely to Him who had led in the work, given faith and
means for it, and helped in it from first to last. The property was
placed in the hands of eleven trustees, chosen by Mr. Müller, and the
deeds were enrolled in chancery. Arrangements were made that the house
should be open to visitors only on Wednesday afternoons, as about one
hour and a half were necessary to see the whole building.

Scarcely were the orphans thus housed on Ashley Down, before Mr.
Müller''s heart felt enlarged desire that one thousand, instead of three
hundred, might enjoy such privileges of temporal provision and spiritual
instruction; and, before the new year, 1851, had dawned, this yearning
had matured into a purpose. With his uniform carefulness and
prayerfulness, he sought to be assured that he was not following
self-will, but the will of God; and again in the scales of a pious
judgment the reasons for and against were conscientiously weighed. Would
he be going ''beyond his measure,'' spiritually, or naturally? Was not the
work, with its vast correspondence and responsibility, already
sufficiently great? Would not a new orphan house for three hundred
orphans cost another fifteen thousand pounds, or, if built for seven
hundred, with the necessary ground, thirty-five thousand? And, even when
built and fitted and filled, would there not be the providing for daily
wants, which is a perpetual care, and cannot be paid for at once like a
site and a building? It would demand eight thousand pounds annual outlay
to provide for another seven hundred little ones. To all objections the
one all-sufficient answer was the all-sufficient God; and, because Mr.
Müller''s eye was on His power, wisdom, and riches, his own weakness,
folly, and poverty were forgotten. Another objection was suggested: What
if he should succeed in thus housing and feeding a thousand poor waifs,
what would become of the institution after his death? The reply is
memorable: "My business is, with all my might, to serve my own
generation by the will of God: in so doing I shall best serve the next
generation, should the Lord Jesus tarry." Were such objection valid, it
were as valid against beginning any work likely to outlive the worker.
And Mr. Müller remembered how Francke at Halle had to meet the same
objection when, now over two hundred years ago, he founded the largest
charitable establishment which, up to 1851, existed in the world. But
when, after about thirty years of personal superintendence, Francke was
taken away, his son-in-law, as we have seen, became the director. That
fellow countryman who had spoken to Mr. Müller''s soul in 1826, thus
twenty-five years later encouraged him to go forward, to do his own duty
and leave the future to the Eternal God.

Several reasons are recorded by Mr. Müller as specially influencing
still further advance: the many applications that could not, for want of
room, be accepted; the low moral state of the poorhouses to which these
children of poverty were liable to be sent; the large number of
distressing cases of orphanhood, known to be deserving of help; the
previous experiences of the Lord''s gracious leading and of the work
itself; his calmness in view of the proposed expansion; and the
spiritual blessing possible to a larger number of homeless children. But
one reason overtopped all others: an enlarged service to man, attempted
and achieved solely in dependence upon God, would afford a
correspondingly weightier witness to the Hearer of prayer. These
reasons, here recorded, will need no repetition in connection with
subsequent expansions of the work, for, at every new stage of advance,
they were what influenced this servant of God.

On January 4, 1851, another offering was received, of three thousand
pounds—the largest single donation up to that date—which, being left
entirely to his own disposal, encouraged him to go forward.

Again, he kept his own counsel. Up to January 25th, he had not
mentioned, even to his own wife, his thought of a further forward
movement, feeling that, to avoid all mistakes, he must first of all get
clear light from God, and not darken it by misleading human counsel. Not
until the Twelfth Report of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution was
issued, was the public apprised of his purpose, with God''s help to
provide for seven hundred more needy orphans.

Up to October 2, 1851, only about eleven hundred pounds had been given
directly toward the second proposed orphan house, and, up to May 26th
following, a total of some thirty-five hundred pounds. But George Müller
remembered one who, "after he had patiently endured, obtained the
promise." He had waited over two years before all means needful for the
first house had been supplied, and could wait still longer, if so God
willed it, for the answers to present prayers for means to build a
second.

After waiting upwards of nineteen months for the building fund for the
second house, and receiving, almost daily, something in answer to
prayer, on January 4, 1853, he had intimation that there were about to
be paid him, as the joint donation of several Christians, eighty-one
hundred pounds, of which he appropriated six thousand for the building
fund. Again he was not surprised nor excited, though exceeding joyful
and triumphant in God. Just two years previous, when recording the
largest donation yet received,—three thousand pounds,—he had recorded
also his expectation of still greater things; and now a donation between
two and three times as large was about to come into his hands. It was
not the amount of money, however, that gave him his overflowing delight,
but the fact that not in vain had he made his boast in God.

As now some four hundred and eighty-three orphans were waiting for
admission, he was moved to pray that soon the way might be opened for
the new building to be begun. James i. 4 was deeply impressed upon him
as the injunction now to be kept before him: "But let patience have her
perfect work, that ye may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing."

On May 26, 1853, the total sum available for the new building was about
twelve thousand five hundred pounds, and over five hundred orphans had
applied. Twice this sum would be needed, however, before the new house
could be begun without risk of debt.

On January 8, 1855, several Christian friends united in the promise that
fifty-seven hundred pounds should be paid to him for the work of God,
and of this, thirty-four hundred was by him set apart for the building
fund. As there were now between seven hundred and eight hundred
applicants, it seemed of God that, at least, a site should be secured
for another new orphan house; and a few weeks later Mr. Müller applied
for the purchase of two fields adjoining the site of the first house. As
they could not, however, be sold at that time, the only resource was to
believe that the Lord had other purposes, or would give better ground
than that on which His servant had set his mind.

Further thought and prayer suggested to him that two houses could be
built instead of one, and located on each side of the existing building,
upon the ground already owned. Accordingly it was determined to begin,
on the south side, the erection of a house to accommodate four hundred
orphans, there being money in the bank, or soon to be available,
sufficient to build, fit up, and furnish it.

On May 26, 1856, nearly thirty thousand pounds were in hand for the new
Orphan House No. 2; and on November 12, 1857, this house was opened for
four hundred additional orphans, and there was a balance of nearly
twenty-three hundred pounds. The God who provided the building furnished
the helpers, without either difficulty or advertising.

With the beginning of the new year, Mr. Müller began to lay aside six
hundred pounds as the first of the appropriations for the third orphan
house, and the steps which led to the accomplishment of this work, also,
were identical with those taken hitherto. A purchase was made of
additional ground, adjoining the two buildings; and, as there were so
many applicants and the cost of providing for a larger number would be
but little more, it was determined to build so as to receive four
hundred and fifty instead of three hundred, rejoicing that, in every
enlargement of the work, it would be more apparent how much one poor
man, simply trusting in God, can bring about by prayer; and that thus
other children of God might be led to carry on the work of God in
dependence solely on Him, and generally to trust Him more in all
circumstances and positions.

Orphan House No. 3 was opened March 12, 1862, and with over ten thousand
pounds in hand for current expenses. All the helpers needed had not then
been supplied, but this delay was only a new incentive to believing
prayer: and, instead of once, thrice, a day, God was besought to
provide suitable persons. One after another was thus added, and in no
case too late, so that the reception of children was not hindered nor
was the work embarrassed.

Still further enlargement seemed needful, for the same reasons as
previously. There was an increasing demand for accommodation of new
applicants, and past experience of God''s wondrous dealings urged him
both to attempt and to expect greater things. Orphan Houses Nos. 4 and 5
began to loom up above his horizon of faith. By May 26, 1862, he had
over sixty-six hundred pounds to apply on their erection. In November,
1864, a large donation of five thousand pounds was received from a donor
who would let neither his name nor residence be known, and by this time
about twenty-seven thousand pounds had thus accumulated toward the fifty
thousand required. As more than half the requisite sum was thus in hand,
the purchase of a site might safely be made and the foundations for the
buildings be laid. Mr. Müller eyes had, for years, been upon land
adjoining the three houses already built, separated from them only by
the turnpike road. He called to see the agent, and found that the
property was subject to a lease that had yet two years to run. This
obstacle only incited to new prayer, but difficulties seemed to
increase: the price asked was too high, and the Bristol Waterworks
Company was negotiating for this same piece of land for reservoir
purposes. Nevertheless God successively removed all hindrances, so that
the ground was bought and conveyed to the trustees in March, 1865; and,
after the purchase-money was paid, about twenty-five thousand pounds yet
remained for the structures. Both the cost and the inconvenience of
building would be greatly lessened by erecting both houses at the same
time; and God was therefore asked for ample means speedily to complete
the whole work.

In May, 1866, over thirty-four thousand pounds being at Mr. Müller''s
disposal, No. 4 was commenced; and in January following, No. 5 also. Up
to the end of March, 1867, over fifty thousand pounds had been supplied,
leaving but six thousand more needful to fit and furnish the two
buildings for occupancy. By the opening of February, 1868. fifty-eight
thousand pounds in all had been donated; so that, on November 5, 1868,
new Orphan House No. 4, and on January 6, 1870, No. 5, were thrown open,
a balance of several thousand pounds remaining for general purposes.
Thus, early in 1870, the orphan work had reached its complete outfit, in
five large buildings on Ashley Down with accommodations for two thousand
orphans and for all needed teachers and assistants.

Thus have been gathered, into one chapter, the facts about the erection
of this great monument to a prayer-hearing God on Ashley Down, though
the work of building covered so many years. Between the first decision
to build, in 1845, and the opening of the third house, in 1862, nearly
seventeen years had elapsed, and before No. 5 was opened, in 1870,
twenty-five years. The work was one in its plan and purpose. At each new
stage it supplies only a wider application and illustration of the same
laws of life and principles of conduct, as, from the outset of the work
in Bristol, had with growing power controlled George Müller. His one
supreme aim was the glory of God; his one sole resort, believing prayer;
his one trusted oracle, the inspired Word; and his one divine Teacher,
the Holy Spirit. One step taken in faith and prayer had prepared for
another; one act of trust had made him bolder to venture upon another,
implying a greater apparent risk and therefore demanding more implicit
trust. But answered prayer was rewarded faith, and every new risk only
showed that there was no risk in confidently leaning upon the truth and
faithfulness of God.

One cannot but be impressed, in visiting the orphan houses, with several
prominent features, and first of all their magnitude. They are very
spacious, with about seventeen hundred large windows, and accommodations
for over two thousand inmates. They are also very substantial, being
built of stone and made to last. They are scrupulously plain; utility
rather than beauty seems conspicuously stamped upon them, within and
without. Economy has been manifestly a ruling law in their construction;
the furniture is equally unpretentious and unostentatious; and, as to
garniture, there is absolutely none. To some few, they are almost too
destitute of embellishment, and Mr. Müller has been blamed for not
introducing some aesthetic features which might relieve this bald
utilitarianism and serve to educate the taste of these orphans.

To all such criticisms, there are two or three adequate answers. First,
Mr. Müller subordinated everything to his one great purpose, the
demonstration of the fact that the Living God is the Hearer of prayer.
Second, he felt himself to be the steward of God''s property, and he
hesitated to spend one penny on what was not necessary to the frugal
carrying on of the work of God. He felt that all that could be spared
without injury to health, a proper mental training, and a thorough
scriptural and spiritual education, should be reserved for the relief of
the necessities of the poor and destitute elsewhere. And again, he felt
that, as these orphans were likely to be put at service in plain homes,
and compelled to live frugally, any surroundings which would accustom
them to indulge refined tastes, might by contrast make them discontented
with their future lot. And so he studied to promote simply their health
and comfort, and to school them to contentment when the necessities of
life were supplied.

But, more than this, a moment''s serious thought will show that, had he
surrounded them with those elegancies which elaborate architecture and
the other fine arts furnish, he might have been even more severely
criticised. He would have been spending the gifts of the poor who often
sorely denied themselves for the sake of these orphans, to purchase
embellishments or secure decorations which, if they had adorned the
humble homes of thousands of donors, would have made their gifts
impossible. When we remember how many offerings, numbering tens of
thousands, were, like the widow''s mites, very small in themselves, yet,
relatively to ability, very large, it will be seen how incongruous it
would have been to use the gifts, saved only by limiting even the wants
of the givers, to buy for the orphans what the donors could not and
would not afford for themselves.

Cleanness, neatness, method, and order, however, everywhere reign, and
honest labour has always had, at the orphan houses, a certain dignity.
The tracts of land, adjoining the buildings, are set apart as
vegetable-gardens, where wholesome exercise is provided for the orphan
boys, and, at the same time, work that helps to provide daily food, and
thus train them in part to self-support.

Throughout these houses studious care is exhibited, as to methodical
arrangement. Each child has a square and numbered compartment for
clothes, six orphans being told off, at a time, in each section, to take
charge. The boys have each three suits, and the girls, five dresses
each, the girls being taught to make and mend their own garments. In the
nursery, the infant children have books and playthings to occupy and
amuse them, and are the objects of tender maternal care. Several
children are often admitted to the orphanage from one family, in order
to avoid needless breaking of household ties by separation. The average
term of residence is about ten years, though some orphans have been
there for seventeen.

The daily life is laid out with regularity and goes on like clockwork in
punctuality. The children rise at six and are expected to be ready at
seven, the girls for knitting and the boys for reading, until eight
o''clock, when breakfast is served. Half an hour later there is a brief
morning service, and the school begins at ten. Half an hour of
recreation on the playground prepares for the one-o''clock dinner, and
school is resumed, until four; then comes an hour and a half of play or
outdoor exercise, a half-hour service preceding the six-o''clock meal.
Then the girls ply the needle, and the boys are in school, until
bedtime, the younger children going to rest at eight, and the older, at
nine. The food is simple, ample, and nutritious, consisting of bread,
oatmeal, milk, soups, meat, rice, and vegetables. Everything is adjusted
to one ultimate end; to use Mr. Müller''s own words: "We aim at this:
that, if any of them do not turn out well, temporally or spiritually,
and do not become useful members of society, it shall not at least be
our fault." The most thorough and careful examination of the whole
methods of the institution will only satisfy the visitor that it will
not be the fault of those who superintend this work, if the orphans are
not well fitted, body and soul, for the work of life, and are not
prepared for a blessed immortality.

SOME one has quaintly said, in commenting upon the Twenty-third Psalm,
that "the coach in which the Lord''s saints ride has not only a driver,
but two footmen"—"goodness and mercy shall follow me."

Surely these two footmen of the Lord, in their celestial livery of
grace, followed George Müller all the days of his life. Wonderful as is
the story of the building of those five orphan houses on Ashley Down,
many other events and experiences no less showed the goodness and mercy
of God, and must not be unrecorded in these pages, if we are to trace,
however imperfectly, His gracious dealings; and having, by one
comprehensive view, taken in the story of the orphan homes, we may
retrace our steps to the year when the first of these houses was
planned, and, following another path, look at Mr. Müller''s personal and
domestic life.

He himself loved to trace the Lord''s goodness and mercy, and he saw
abundant proofs that they had followed him. A few instances may be
given, from different departments of experience, as representative
examples.

The Lord''s tender care was manifest as to his beloved daughter Lydia. It
became clear in the year 1843, that, both for the relief of the mother
and the profit of the daughter, it would be better that Lydia should be
taught elsewhere than at home; and in answer to prayer, her father was
divinely directed to a Christian sister, whose special gifts in the way
of instructing and training children were manifestly from the Spirit,
who divides unto all believers severally as He will. She seemed to be
marked of God, as the woman to whom was to be intrusted the responsible
task of superintending the education of Lydia. Mr. Müller both expected
and desired to pay for such training, and asked for the account, which
in the first instance he paid, but the exact sum was returned to him
anonymously; and, for the six remaining years of his daughter''s stay, he
could get no further bills for her schooling. Thus God provided for the
board and education of this only child, not only without cost to her
parents, but to their intense satisfaction as being under the true
"nurture and admonition of the Lord;" for while at this school, in
April, 1846, Lydia found peace in believing, and began that beautiful
life in the Lord Jesus Christ, that, for forty-four years afterward, so
singularly exhibited His image.

Many Christian parents have made the fatal mistake of intrusting their
children''s education to those whose gifts were wholly intellectual and
not spiritual, and who have misled the young pupils entrusted to their
care, into an irreligious or infidel life, or, at best, a career of mere
intellectualism and worldly ambition. In not a few instances, all the
influences of a pious home have been counteracted by the atmosphere of a
school which, if not godless, has been without that fragrance of
spiritual devoutness and consecration which is indispensable to the true
training of impressible children during the plastic years when character
is forming for eternity!

Goodness and mercy followed Mr. and Mrs. Müller conspicuously in their
sojourn in Germany in 1845, which covered about three months, from July
19th to October 11th.

God plainly led to Stuttgart, where brethren had fallen into grievous
errors and needed again a helping hand. When the strong impression laid
hold of Mr. Müller, more than two months before his departure for the
Continent, that he was to return there for a season, he began definitely
to pray for means to go with, on May 3rd, and, within a quarter hour
after, five hundred pounds were received, the donor specifying that the
money was given for all expenses needful, "preparatory to, and attendant
upon" this proposed journey. The same goodness and mercy followed all
his steps while abroad. Provision was made, in God''s own strange way,
for suitable lodgings in Stuttgart, at a time when the city was
exceptionally crowded, a wealthy retired surgeon, who had never before
rented apartments, being led to offer them. All Mr. Müller''s labours
were attended with blessing: during part of the time he held as many as
eight meetings a week; and he was enabled to publish eleven tracts in
German, and judiciously to scatter over two hundred and twenty thousand
of them, as well as nearly four thousand of his Narrative, and yet evade
interference from the police.

One experience of this sojourn abroad should have special mention for
the lesson it suggests, both in charity for others'' views and loving
adaptation to circumstances. A providential opening occurred to address
meetings of about one hundred and fifty members of the state church. In
his view the character of such assemblies was not wholly conformed to
the Scripture pattern, and hence did not altogether meet his approval;
but such opportunity was afforded to bear testimony for the truth''s
sake, and to exhibit Christian unity upon essentials, for love''s sake,
that he judged it of the Lord that he should enter this open door. Those
who knew Mr. Müller but little, but knew his positive convictions and
uncompromising loyalty to them, might suspect that he would have little
forbearance with even minor errors, and would not bend himself from his
stern attitude of inflexibility to accommodate himself to those who were
ensnared by them. But those who knew him better, saw that he held fast
the form of sound words with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
Like Paul, ever ready to be made all things to all men that by all means
he might save some, in his whole character and conduct nothing shone
more radiantly beautiful, than Love. He felt that he who would lift up
others must bow himself to lay hold on them; that to help brethren we
must bear with them, not insisting upon matters of minor importance as
though they were essential and fundamental. Hence his course, instead of
being needlessly repellant, was tenderly conciliatory; and it was a
conspicuous sign of grace that, while holding his own views of truth and
duty so positively and tenaciously, the intolerance of bigotry was so
displaced by the forbearance of charity that, when the Lord so led and
circumstances so required, he could conform for a time to customs whose
propriety he doubted, without abating either the earnestness of his
conviction or the integrity of his testimony.

God''s goodness and mercy were seen in the fact that, whenever more
liberal things were devised for Him, He responded in providing liberally
means to carry out such desires. This was abundantly illustrated not
only in the orphan work, but in the history of the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution; when, for years together, the various branches of this work
grew so rapidly, until the point of full development was reached. The
time indeed came when, in some departments, it pleased God that
contraction should succeed expansion, but even here goodness ruled, for
it was afterward seen that it was because other brethren had been led
to take up such branches of the Lord''s work, in all of which
developments Mr. Müller as truly rejoiced as though it had been his work
alone that was honoured of God.

The aiding of brethren in the mission fields grew more and more dear to
his heart, and the means to indulge his unselfish desires were so
multiplied that, in 1846, he found, on reviewing the history of the
Lord''s dealings, that he had been enabled to expend about seven times
as much of late years as previously. It may here be added, again by way
of anticipation, that when, nineteen years later, in 1865, he sat down
to apportion to such labourers in the Lord as he was wont to assist, the
sums he felt it desirable to send to each, he found before him the names
of one hundred and twenty-two such! Goodness and mercy indeed! Here
was but one branch of his work, and yet to what proportions and
fruitfulness it had grown! He needed four hundred and sixty-six pounds
to send them to fill out his appropriations, and he lacked ninety-two of
this amount. He carried the lack to the Lord, and that evening
received five pounds, and the next morning a hundred more, and a
further "birthday memorial" of fifty, so that he had in all thirty-seven
more than he had asked.

What goodness and mercy followed him in the strength he ever had to bear
the heavy loads of care incident to his work! The Lord''s coach bore him
and his burdens together. Day by day his gracious Master preserved his
peace unbroken, though disease found its way into this large family,
though fit homes and work must be found for outgoing orphans, and fit
care and training for incoming orphans; though crises were constantly
arising and new needs constantly recurring, grave matters daily demanded
prayer and watching, and perpetual diligence and vigilance were needful;
for the Lord was his Helper, and carried all his loads.

During the winter of 1846-7 there was a peculiar season of dearth. Would
God''s goodness and mercy fail? There were those who looked on, more than
half incredulous, saying to themselves if not to others, "I wonder how
it is now with Mr. Müller and his orphans! If he is able to provide for
them now as he has been, we will say nothing." But all through this time
of widespread want his witness was, "We lack nothing: God helps us."
Faith led when the way was too dark for sight; in fact the darker the
road the more was the Hand felt that leads the blind by a way they know
not. They went through that winter as easily as through any other from
the beginning of the work!

Was it no sign that God''s ''footmen'' followed George Müller that the work
never ceased to be both a work of faith and of prayer? that no
difficulties or discouragements, no successes or triumphs, ever caused
for an hour a departure from the sublime essential principles on which
the work was based, or a diversion from the purpose for which it had
been built up?

We have heard it said of a brother, much honoured of God in beginning a
work of faith, that, when it had grown to greater proportions, he seemed
to change its base to that of a business scheme. How it glorifies God
that the holy enterprise, planted in Bristol in 1834, has known no such
alteration in its essential features during all these years! Though the
work grew, and its needs with it, until the expenses were twofold,
threefold, fourfold, and, at last, seventyfold what they were when that
first Orphan House was opened in Wilson Street, there has been no
change of base, never any looking to man for patronage or support,
never any dependence upon a regular income or fixed endowment. God has
been, all through these years, as at first, the sole Patron and
Dependence. The Scriptural Knowledge Institution has not been wrecked on
the rocks of financial failure, nor has it even drifted away from its
original moorings in the safe anchorage-ground of the Promises of
Jehovah.

Was it not goodness and mercy that kept George Müller ever grateful as
well as faithful! He did not more constantly feel his need of faith and
prayer than his duty and privilege of abounding joy and praise. Some
might think that, after such experiences of answered prayer, one would
be less and less moved by them, as the novelty was lost in the
uniformity of such interpositions. But no. When, in June, 1853, at a
time of sore need, the Lord sent, in one sum, three hundred pounds, he
could scarcely contain his triumphant joy in God. He walked up and down
his room for a long time, his heart overflowing and his eyes too, his
mouth filled with laughter and his voice with song, while he gave
himself afresh to the faithful Master he served. God''s blessings were to
him always new and fresh. Answered prayers never lost the charm of
novelty; like flowers plucked fresh every hour from the gardens of God,
they never got stale, losing none of their beauty or celestial
fragrance.

And what goodness and mercy was it that never suffered prayerfulness and
patience to relax their hold, either when answers seemed to come fast
and thick like snow-flakes, or when the heavens seemed locked up and
faith had to wait patiently and long! Every day brought new demands for
continuance in prayer. In fact, as Mr. Müller testifies, the only
difference between latter and former days was that the difficulties were
greater in proportion as the work was larger. But he adds that this was
to be expected, for the Lord gives faith for the very purpose of trying
it for the glory of His own name and the good of him who has the faith,
and it is by these very trials that trust learns the secret of its
triumphs.

Goodness and mercy not only guided but also guarded this servant of
God. God''s footmen bore a protecting shield which was always over him.
Amid thousands of unseen perils, occasionally some danger was known,
though generally after it was passed. While at Keswick labouring in
1847, for example, a man, taken deranged while lodging in the same
house, shot himself. It afterward transpired that he had an impression
that Mr. Müller had designs on his life, and had he met Mr. Müller
during this insane attack he would probably have shot him with the
loaded pistol he carried about on his person.

The pathway of this man of God sometimes led through deep waters of
affliction, but goodness and mercy still followed, and held him up. In
the autumn of 1852, his beloved brother-in-law, Mr. A. N. Groves, came
back from the East Indies, very ill; and in May of the next year, after
blessed witness for God, he fell asleep at Mr. Müller''s house. To him
Mr. Müller owed much through grace at the outset of his labours in 1829.
By his example his faith had been stimulated and helped when, with no
visible support or connection with any missionary society, Mr. Groves
had gone to Baghdad with wife and children, for the sake of mission work
in this far-off field, resigning a lucrative practice of about fifteen
hundred pounds a year. The tie between these men was very close and
tender and the loss of this brother-in-law gave keen sorrow.

In July following, Mr. and Mrs. Müller went through a yet severer trial.
Lydia, the beloved daughter and only child,—born in 1832 and new-born
in 1846, and at this time twenty years old and a treasure without
price,—was taken ill in the latter part of June, and the ailment
developed into a malignant typhoid which, two weeks later, brought her
to the gates of death. These parents had to face the prospect of being
left childless. But faith triumphed and prayer prevailed. Their darling
Lydia was spared to be, for many years to come, a blessing beyond words,
not only to them and to her future husband, but to many others in a
wider circle of influence. Mr. Müller found, in this trial, a special
proof of God''s goodness and mercy, which he gratefully records, in the
growth in grace, evidenced in his entire and joyful acquiescence in the
Father''s will, when, with such a loss apparently before him, his
confidence was undisturbed that all things would work together for good.
He could not but contrast with this experience of serenity, that broken
peace and complaining spirit with which he had met a like trial in
August, 1831, twenty-one years before. How, like a magnet among steel
filings, the thankful heart finds the mercies and picks them out of the
black dust of sorrow and suffering!

The second volume of Mr. Müller''s Narrative closes with a paragraph in
which he formally disclaims as impudent presumption and pretension all
high rank as a miracle-worker, and records his regret that any work,
based on scriptural promises and built on the simple lines of faith and
prayer, should be accounted either phenomenal or fanatical.

The common ways of accounting for its success would be absurdly
ridiculous and amusing were they not so sadly unbelieving. Those who
knew little or nothing, either of the exercise of faith or the
experience of God''s faithfulness, resorted to the most God-dishonouring
explanations of the work. Some said: "Mr. Müller is a foreigner; his
methods are so novel as to attract attention." Others thought that the
"Annual Reports brought in the money," or suggested that he had "a
secret treasure." His quiet reply was, that his being a foreigner
would be more likely to repel than to attract confidence; that the
novelty would scarcely avail him after more than a score of years; that
other institutions which issued reports did not always escape want and
debt; but, as to the secret treasure to which he was supposed to have
access, he felt constrained to confess that there was more in that
supposition than the objectors were aware of. He had indeed a Treasury,
inexhaustible—in the promises of a God unchangeably faithful—from
which he admits that he had already in 1856 drawn for twenty-two years,
and in all over one hundred and thirteen thousand pounds. As to the
Reports, it may be worth while to notice that he never but once in his
life advertised the public of any need, and that was the need of more
orphans—more to care for in the name of the Lord—a single and
singular ease of advertising, by which he sought not to increase his
income, but his expenditure—not asking the public to aid him in
supporting the needy, but to increase the occasion of his outlay!

So far was he from depending upon any such sources of supply as the
unbelieving world might think, that it was in the drying up of all such
channels that he found the opportunity of his faith and of God''s power.
The visible treasure was often so small that it was reduced to nothing,
but the invisible Treasure was God''s riches in glory, and could be drawn
from without limit. This it was to which he looked alone, and in which
he felt that he had a river of supply that can never run dry.*

The orphan work had, to Mr. Müller, many charms which grew on him as he
entered more fully into it. While his main hope was to be the means of
spiritual health to these children, he had the joy of seeing how God
used these homes for the promotion of their physical welfare also, and,
in cases not a few, for the entire renovation of their weak and diseased
bodies. It must be remembered that most of them owed their orphan
condition to that great destroyer, Consumption. Children were often
brought to the orphan houses thoroughly permeated by the poison of bad
blood, with diseased tendencies, and sometimes emaciated and
half-starved, having had neither proper food nor medical care.

For example, in the spring of 1855, four children from five to nine
years old, and of one family, were admitted to the orphanage, all in a
deplorable state from lack of both nursing and nutrition. It was a
serious question whether they should be admitted at all, as such cases
tended to turn the institution into a hospital, and absorb undue care
and time. But to dismiss them seemed almost inhuman, certainly
inhumane. So, trusting in God, they were taken in and cared for with
parental love. A few weeks later these children were physically
unrecognizable, so rapid had been the improvement in health, and
probably there were with God''s blessing four graves less to be dug.

The trials incident to the moral and spiritual condition of the orphans
were even greater, however, than those caused by ill health and
weakness. When children proved incorrigibly bad, they were expelled,
lest they should corrupt others, for the institution was not a
reformatory, as it was not a hospital. In 1849, a boy, of less than
eight years, had to be sent away as a confirmed liar and thief, having
twice run off with the belongings of other children and gloried in his
juvenile crimes. Yet the forbearance exercised even in his case was
marvelously godlike, for, during over five years, he had been the
subject of private admonitions and prayers and all other methods of
reclamation; and, when expulsion became the last resort, he was solemnly
and with prayer, before all the others, sent away from the orphan house,
that if possible such a course might prove a double blessing, a remedy
to him and a warning to others; and even then this young practised
sinner was followed, in his expulsion, by loving supplication.

Towards the end of November, 1857, it was found that a serious leak in
the boiler of the heating apparatus of house No. 1 would make repairs at
once necessary, and as the boilers were encased in bricks and a new
boiler might be required, such repairs must consume time. Meanwhile how
could three hundred children, some of them very young and tender, be
kept warm? Even if gas-stoves could be temporarily set up, chimneys
would be needful to carry off the impure air; and no way of heating was
available during repairs, even if a hundred pounds were expended to
prevent risk of cold. Again Mr. Müller turned to the Living God, and,
trusting in Him, decided to have the repairs begun. A day or so before
the fires had to be put out, a bleak north wind set in. The work could
no longer be delayed; yet weather, prematurely cold for the season,
threatened these hundreds of children with hurtful exposure. The Lord
was boldly appealed to. "Lord, these are Thy orphans: be pleased to
change this north wind into a south wind, and give the workmen a mind to
work that the job may be speedily done."

The evening before the repairs actually began, the cold blast was still
blowing; but on that day a south wind blew, and the weather was so mild
that no fire was needful! Not only so, but, as Mr. Müller went into the
cellar with the overseer of the work, to see whether the repairs could
in no way be expedited, he heard him say, in the hearing of the men,
"they will work late this evening, and come very early again to-morrow."
"We would rather, sir," was the reply, "work all night." And so,
within about thirty hours, the fire was again burning to heat the water
in the boiler; and, until the apparatus was again in order, that
merciful soft south wind had continued to blow. Goodness and mercy were
following the Lord''s humble servant, made the more conspicuous by the
crises of special trial and trouble.

Every new exigency provoked new prayer and evoked new faith. When, in
1862, several boys were ready to be apprenticed, and there were no
applications such as were desired, prayer was the one resort, as
advertising would tend to bring applications from masters who sought
apprentices for the sake of the premium. But every one of the eighteen
boys was properly bound over to a Christian master, whose business was
suitable and who would receive the lad into his own family.

About the same time one of the drains was obstructed which runs about
eleven feet underground. When three holes had been dug and as many
places in the drain tapped in vain, prayer was offered that in the
fourth case the workmen might be guided to the very spot where the
stoppage existed—and the request was literally answered.

Three instances of marked deliverance, in answer to prayer, are
specially recorded for the year between May 26, 1864, and the same date
in 1865, which should not be passed by without at least a mention.

First, in the great drought of the summer of 1864, when the fifteen
large cisterns in the three orphan houses were empty, and the nine deep
wells, and even the good spring which had never before failed, were
almost all dry. Two or three thousand gallons of water were daily
required, and daily prayer was made to the God of the rain. See how God
provided, while pleased to withhold the supply from above! A farmer,
near by, supplied, from his larger wells, about half the water needful,
the rest being furnished by the half-exhausted wells on Ashley Down;
and, when he could no longer spare water, without a day''s interval,
another farmer offered a supply from a brook which ran through his
fields, and thus there was abundance until the rains replenished
cisterns and wells.*

* About twenty years later the Bristol Water Works Co. introduced pipes
and thus a permanent and unfailing supply.

Second, when, for three years, scarlet and typhus fevers and smallpox,
being prevalent in Bristol and the vicinity threatened the orphans,
prayer was again made to Him who is the God of health as well as of
rain. There was no case of scarlet or typhus fever during the whole
time, though smallpox was permitted to find an entrance into the
smallest of the orphan houses. Prayer was still the one resort. The
disease spread to the other houses, until at one time fifteen were ill
with it. The cases, however, were mercifully light, and the Lord was
besought to allow the epidemic to spread no further. Not another child
was taken; and when, after nine months, the disease altogether
disappeared, not one child had died of it, and only one teacher or adult
had had an attack, and that was very mild. What ravages the disease
might have made among the twelve hundred inmates of these orphan houses,
had it then prevailed as later, in 1872!

Third, tremendous gales visited Bristol and neighbourhood in January,
1865. The roofs of the orphan houses were so injured as to be laid open
in at least twenty places, and large panes of glass were broken. The day
was Saturday, and no glazier and slater could be had before Monday. So
the Lord of wind and weather was besought to protect the exposed
property during the interval. The wind calmed down, and the rain was
restrained until midday of Wednesday, when the repairs were about
finished, but heavy rainfalls drove the slaters from the roof. One
exposed opening remained and much damage threatened; but, in answer to
prayer, the rain was stayed, and the work resumed. No damage had been
done while the last opening was unrepaired for it had exposed the
building from the south, while the rain came from the north.

Mr. Müller records these circumstances with his usual particularity, as
part of his witness to the Living God, and to the goodness and mercy
that closely and continually followed him.

During the next year, 1865-6, scarlet fever broke out in the orphanage.
In all thirty-nine children were ill, but all recovered. Whooping-cough
also made its appearance; but though, during that season, it was not
only very prevalent but very malignant in Bristol, in all the three
houses there were but seventeen cases, and the only fatal one was that
of a little girl with constitutionally weak lungs.

During this same year, however, the Spirit of God wrought mightily among
the girls, as in the previous year among the boys, so that over one
hundred became deeply earnest seekers after salvation; and so, even in
tribulation, consolation abounded in Christ. Mr. Müller and his wife and
helpers now implored God to deepen and broaden this work of His Spirit.
Towards the end of the year closing in May, 1866, Emma Bunn, an orphan
girl of seventeen, was struck with consumption. Though, for fourteen
years, she had been under Mr. Müller''s care, she was, in this dangerous
illness, still careless and indifferent; and, as she drew near to death,
her case continued as hopeless as ever. Prayer was unceasing for her;
and it pleased God suddenly to reveal Christ to her as her Saviour.
Great self-loathing now at once took the place of former indifference;
confession of sin, of previous callousness of conscience; and
unspeakable joy in the Lord, of former apathy and coldness. It was a
spiritual miracle—this girl''s sudden transformation into a witness for
God, manifesting deepest conviction for past sin and earnest concern for
others. Her thoughtless and heedless state had been so well known that
her conversion and dying messages were now the Lord''s means of the most
extensive and God-glorifying work ever wrought up to that time among the
orphans. In one house alone three hundred and fifty were led to seek
peace in believing.

What lessons lie hidden—nay, lie on the very surface—to be read of
every willing observer of these events! Prayer can break even a hard
heart; a memory, stored with biblical truth and pious teaching, will
prove, when once God''s grace softens the heart and unlooses the tongue,
a source of both personal growth in grace and of capacity for wide
service to others. We are all practically too careless of the training
of children, and too distrustful of young converts. Mr. Müller was more
and more impressed by the triumphs of the grace of God as seen in
children converted at the tender age of nine or ten and holding the
beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end.

These facts and experiences, gleaned, like handfuls of grain, from a
wide field, show the character both of the seed sown and the harvest
reaped, from the sowing.

Again, when, in 1866, cholera developed in England, in answer to special
prayer not one case of this disease was known in the orphan houses;
and when, in the same autumn, whooping-cough and measles broke out,
though eight children had the former and two hundred and sixty-two, the
latter, not one child died, or was afterward debilitated by the attack.
From May, 1866, to May, 1867, out of over thirteen hundred children
under care, only eleven died, considerably less than one per cent.

That severe and epidemic disease should find its way into the orphanages
at all may seem strange to those who judge God''s faithfulness by
appearances, but many were the compensations for such trials. By them
not only were the hearts of the children often turned to God, but the
hearts of helpers in the Institution were made more sympathetic and
tender, and the hearts of God''s people at large were stirred up to
practical and systematic help. God uses such seeming calamities as
''advertisements'' of His work; many who would not have heard of the
Institution, or on whom what they did hear would have made little
impression, were led to take a deep interest in an orphanage where
thousands of little ones were exposed to the ravages of some malignant
and dangerous epidemic.

Looking back, in 1865, after thirty-one years, upon the work thus far
done for the Lord, Mr. Müller gratefully records that, during the entire
time, he had been enabled to hold fast the original principles on which
the work was based on March 5, 1834. He had never once gone into debt;
he had sought for the Institution no patron but the Living God; and he
had kept to the line of demarcation between believers and unbelievers,
in all his seeking for active helpers in the work.

His grand purpose, in all his labours, having been, from the beginning,
the glory of God, in showing what could be done through prayer and
faith, without any leaning upon man, his unequivocal testimony is:
"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." Though for about five years they
had, almost daily, been in the constant trial of faith, they were as
constantly proving His faithfulness. The work had rapidly grown, till it
assumed gigantic proportions, but so did the help of God keep pace with
all the needs and demands of its growth.

In January, 1866, Mr. Henry Craik, who had for thirty-six years been Mr.
Müller''s valued friend, and, since 1832, his coworker in Bristol, fell
asleep after an illness of seven months. In Devonshire these two
brethren had first known each other, and the acquaintance had
subsequently ripened, through years of common labour and trial, into an
affection seldom found among men. They were nearly of an age, both being
a little past sixty when Mr. Craik died. The loss was too heavy to have
been patiently and serenely borne, had not the survivor known and felt
beneath him the Everlasting Arms. And even this bereavement, which in
one aspect was an irreparable loss, was seen to be only another proof of
God''s love. The look ahead might be a dark one, the way desolate and
even dangerous, but goodness and mercy were still following very close
behind, and would in every new place of danger or difficulty be at hand
to help over hard places and give comfort and cheer in the night season.

"WITH clouds He covereth the light." No human life is without some
experience of clouded skies and stormy days, and sometimes "the clouds
return after the rain." It is a blessed experience to recognize the
silver lining on the darkest storm cloud, and, better still, to be sure
of the shining of God''s light behind a sky that seems wholly and
hopelessly overcast.

The year 1870 was made forever pathetically memorable by the decease of
Mrs. Müller, who lived just long enough to see the last of the New
Orphan Houses opened. From the outset of the work in November, 1835, for
more than thirty-four years, this beloved, devoted wife had been also a
sympathetic helper.

This wedded life had approached very near to the ideal of connubial
bliss, by reason of mutual fitness, common faith in God and love for His
work, and long association in prayer and service. In their case, the
days of courtship were never passed; indeed the tender and delicate
mutual attentions of those early days rather increased than decreased as
the years went on; and the great maxim was both proven and illustrated,
that the secret of winning love is the secret of keeping it. More than
that, such affection grows and becomes more and more a fountain of
mutual delight. Never had his beloved "Mary" been so precious to her
husband as during the very year of her departure.

This marriage union was so happy that Mr. Müller could not withhold his
loving witness that he never saw her at any time after she became his
wife, without a new feeling of delight. And day by day they were wont to
find at least a few moments of rest together, sitting after dinner, hand
in hand, in loving intercourse of mind and heart, made the more complete
by this touch of physical contact, and, whether in speech or silence,
communing in the Lord. Their happiness in God and in each other was
perennial, perpetual, growing as the years fled by.

Mr. Müller''s solemn conviction was that all this wedded bliss was due to
the fact that she was not only a devoted Christian, but that their one
united object was to live only and wholly for God; that they had always
abundance of work for God, in which they were heartily united; that this
work was never allowed to interfere with the care of their own souls, or
their seasons of private prayer and study of the Scriptures; and that
they were wont daily, and often thrice a day, to secure a time of united
prayer and praise when they brought before the Lord the matters which at
the time called for thanksgiving and supplication.

Mrs. Müller had never been a very vigorous woman, and more than once had
been brought nigh unto death. In October, 1859, after twenty-nine years
of wedded life and love, she had been laid aside by rheumatism and had
continued in great suffering for about nine months, quite helpless and
unable to work; but it was felt to be a special mark of God''s love and
faithfulness that this very affliction was used by Him to reestablish
her in health and strength, the compulsory rest made necessary for the
greater part of a year being in Mr. Müller''s judgment a means of
prolonging her life and period of service for the ten years following.
Thus a severe trial met by them both in faith had issued in much
blessing both to soul and body.

The closing scenes of this beautiful life are almost too sacred to be
unveiled to common eyes. For some few years before her departure, it was
plain that her health and vitality were declining. With difficulty could
she be prevailed on, however, to abate her activity, or, even when a
distressing cough attacked her, to allow a physician to be called. Her
husband carefully guarded and nursed her, and by careful attention to
diet and rest, by avoidance of needless exposure, and by constant resort
to prayer, she was kept alive through much weakness and sometimes much
pain. But, on Saturday night, February 5th, she found that she had not
the use of one of her limbs, and it was obvious that the end was nigh.
Her own mind was clear and her own heart at peace. She herself remarked,
"He will soon come." And a few minutes after four in the afternoon of
the Lord''s day, February 6, 1870, she sweetly passed from human toils
and trials, to be forever with the Lord.

Under the weight of such a sorrow, most men would have sunk into depths
of almost hopeless despair. But this man of God, sustained by a divine
love, at once sought for occasions of thanksgiving; and, instead of
repining over his loss, gratefully remembered and recorded the goodness
of God in taking such a wife, releasing her saintly spirit from the
bondage of weakness, sickness, and pain, rather than leaving her to a
protracted suffering and the mute agony of helplessness; and, above all,
introducing her to her heart''s desire, the immediate presence of the
Lord Jesus, and the higher service of a celestial sphere. Is not that
grief akin to selfishness which dwells so much on our own deprivations
as to be oblivious of the ecstatic gain of the departed saints who,
withdrawn from us and absent from the body, are at home with the Lord?

It is only in those circumstances of extreme trial which prove to
ordinary men a crushing weight, that implicit faith in the Father''s
unfailing wisdom and love proves its full power to sustain. Where
self-will is truly lost in the will of God, the life that is hidden in
Him is most radiantly exhibited in the darkest hour.

The death of this beloved wife afforded an illustration of this. Within
a few hours after this withdrawal of her who had shared with him the
planning and working of these long years of service, Mr. Müller went to
the Monday-evening prayer meeting, then held in Salem Chapel, to mingle
his prayers and praises as usual with those of his brethren. With a
literally shining countenance, he rose and said: "Beloved brethren and
sisters in Christ, I ask you to join with me in hearty praise and
thanksgiving to my precious Lord for His loving kindness in having taken
my darling, beloved wife out of the pain and suffering which she has
endured, into His own presence; and as I rejoice in everything that is
for her, happiness, so I now rejoice as I realize how far happier she
is, in beholding her Lord whom she loved so well, than in any joy she
has known or could know here. I ask you also to pray that the Lord will
so enable me to have fellowship in her joy that my bereaved heart may be
occupied with her blessedness instead of my unspeakable loss." These
remarkable words are supplied by one who was himself present and on
whose memory they made an indelible impression.

This occurrence had a marked effect upon all who were at that meeting.
Mrs. Müller was known by all as a most valuable, lovely, and holy woman
and wife. After nearly forty years of wedded life and love, she had left
the earthly home for the heavenly. To her husband she had been a
blessing beyond description, and to her daughter Lydia, at once a wise
and tender mother and a sympathetic companion. The loss to them both
could never be made up on earth. Yet in these circumstances this man of
God had grace given to forget his own and his daughter''s irreparable
loss, and to praise God for the unspeakable gain to the departed wife
and mother.

The body was laid to rest on February 11th, many thousands of sorrowing
friends evincing the deepest sympathy. Twelve hundred orphans mingled in
the funeral procession, and the whole staff of helpers so far as they
could be spared from the houses. The bereaved husband strangely upheld
by the arm of the Almighty Friend in whom he trusted, took upon himself
the funeral service both at chapel and cemetery. He was taken seriously
ill afterward, but, as soon as his returning strength allowed, he
preached his wife''s funeral sermon—another memorable occasion. It was
the supernatural serenity of his peace in the presence of such a
bereavement that led his attending physician to say to a friend, "I have
never before seen so unhuman a man." Yes, unhuman indeed, though far
from inhuman, lifted above the weakness of mere humanity by a power
not of man.

That funeral sermon was a noble tribute to the goodness of the Lord even
in the great affliction of his life. The text was:

Its three divisions were: "The Lord was good and did good: first, in
giving her to me; second in so long leaving her to me; and third, in
taking her from me." It is happily preserved in Mr. Müller''s journal,
and must be read to be appreciated.*

This union, begun in prayer, was in prayer sanctified to the end. Mrs.
Müller''s chief excellence lay in her devoted piety. She wore that one
ornament which is in the sight of God of great price—the meek and quiet
spirit; the beauty of the Lord her God was upon her. She had
sympathetically shared her husband''s prayers and tears during all the
long trial-time of faith and patience, and partaken of all the joys and
rewards of the triumph hours. Mr. Müller''s own witness to her leaves
nothing more to be added, for it is the tribute of him who knew her
longest and best. He writes:

"She was God''s own gift, exquisitely suited to me even in natural
temperament. Thousands of times I said to her, ''My darling, God Himself
singled you out for me, as the most suitable wife I could possibly wish
to have had.''"

As to culture, she had a basis of sensible practical education,
surmounted and adorned by ladylike accomplishments which she had neither
time nor inclination to indulge in her married life. Not only was she
skilled in the languages and in such higher studies as astronomy, but in
mathematics also; and this last qualification made her for thirty-four
years an invaluable help to her husband, as month by month she examined
all the account-books, and the hundreds of bills of the matrons of the
orphan houses, and with the eye of an expert detected the least mistake.

All her training and natural fitness indicated a providential adaptation
to her work, like "the round peg in the round hole." Her practical
education in needlework, and her knowledge of the material most
serviceable for various household uses, made her competent to direct
both in the purchase and manufacture of cloths and other fabrics for
garments, bed-linen, etc. She moved about those orphan houses like an
angel of Love, taking unselfish delight in such humble ministries as
preparing neat, clean beds to rest the little ones, and covering them
with warm blankets in cold weather. For the sake of Him who took little
children in His arms, she became to these thousands of destitute orphans
a nursing mother.

Shortly after her death, a letter was received from a believing orphan
some seventeen years before sent out to service, asking, in behalf also
of others formerly in the houses, permission to erect a stone over Mrs.
Müller''s grave as an expression of love and grateful remembrance.
Consent being given, hundreds of little offerings came in from orphans
who during the twenty-five years previous had been under her motherly
oversight—a beautiful tribute to her worth and a touching offering from
those who had been to her as her larger family.

The dear daughter Lydia had, two years before Mrs. Müller''s departure,
found in one of her mother''s pocketbooks a sacred memorandum in her own
writing, which she brought to her bereaved father''s notice two days
after his wife had departed. It belongs among the precious relics of her
history. It reads as follows:

"Should it please the Lord to remove M. M. [Mary Müller] by a sudden
dismissal, let none of the beloved survivors consider that it is in the
way of judgment, either to her or to them. She has so often, when
enjoying conscious nearness to the Lord, felt how sweet it would be now
to depart and to be forever with Jesus, that nothing but the shock it
would be to her beloved husband and child, etc. has checked in her the
longing desire that thus her happy spirit might take its flight.
Precious Jesus! Thy will in this as in everything else, and not hers, be
done!"

These words were to Mr. Müller her last legacy; and with the comfort
they gave him, the loving sympathy of his precious Lydia who did all
that a daughter could do to fill a mother''s place, and with the
remembrance of Him who hath said, ''I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee,'' he went on his lonely pilgrim way, rejoicing in the Lord, feeling
nevertheless a wound in his heart, that seemed rather to deepen than to
heal.

Sixteen months passed, when Mr. James Wright, who like Mr. Müller had
been bereft of his companion, asked of him the hand of the beloved Lydia
in marriage. The request took Mr. Müller wholly by surprise, but he felt
that, to no man living, could he with more joyful confidence commit and
intrust his choicest remaining earthly treasure; and, ever solicitous
for others'' happiness rather than his own, he encouraged his daughter to
accept Mr. Wright''s proffered love, when she naturally hesitated on her
father''s account. On November 16, 1871, they were married, and began a
life of mutual prayer and sympathy which, like that of her father and
mother, proved supremely and almost ideally happy, helpful, and useful.

While as yet this event was only in prospect, Mr. Müller felt his own
lonely condition keenly, and much more in view of his daughter''s
expected departure to her husband''s home. He felt the need of some one
to share intimately his toils and prayers, and help him in the Lord''s
work, and the persuasion grew upon him that it was God''s will that he
should marry again. After much prayer, he determined to ask Miss
Susannah Grace Sangar to become his wife, having known her for more than
twenty-five years as a consistent disciple, and believing her to be well
fitted to be his helper in the Lord. Accordingly, fourteen days after
his daughter''s marriage to Mr. Wright, he entered into similar relations
with Miss Sangar, who for years after joined him in prayer, unselfish
giving, and labours for souls.

The second Mrs. Müller was of one mind with her husband as to the
stewardship of the Lord''s property. He found her poor, for what she had
once possessed she had lost; and had she been rich he would have
regarded her wealth as an obstacle to marriage, unfitting her to be his
companion in a self-denial based on scriptural principle. Riches or
hoarded wealth would have been to both of them a snare, and so she also
felt; so that, having still, before her marriage, a remnant of two
hundred pounds, she at once put it at the Lord''s disposal, thus joining
her husband in a life of voluntary poverty; and although subsequent
legacies were paid to her, she continued to the day of her death to be
poor for the Lord''s sake.

The question had often been asked Mr. Müller what would become of the
work when he, the master workman, should be removed. Men find it hard to
get their eyes off the instrument, and remember that there is only,
strictly speaking, one AGENT, for an agent is one who works, and an
instrument is what the agent works with. Though provision might be
made, in a board of trustees, for carrying on the orphan work, where
would be found the man to take the direction of it, a man whose spirit
was so akin to that of the founder that he would trust in God and depend
on Him just as Mr. Müller had done before him? Such were the inquiries
of the somewhat doubtful or fearful observers of the great and
many-branched work carried on under Mr. Müller''s supervision.

To all such questions he had always one answer ready—his one uniform
solution of all cares and perplexities: the Living God. He who had
built the orphan houses could maintain them; He who had raised up one
humble man to oversee the work in His name, could provide for a worthy
successor, like Joshua who not only followed but succeeded Moses.
Jehovah of hosts is not limited in resources.

Nevertheless much prayer was offered that the Lord would provide such a
successor, and, in Mr. James Wright, the prayer was answered. He was not
chosen, as Mr. Müller''s son-in-law, for the choice was made before his
marriage to Lydia Müller was even thought of by him. For more than
thirty years, even from his boyhood, Mr. Wright had been well known to
Mr. Müller, and his growth in the things of God had been watched by him.
For thirteen years he had already been his "right hand" in all most
important matters; and, for nearly all of that time, had been held up
before God as his successor, in the prayers of Mr. and Mrs. Müller, both
of whom felt divinely assured that God would fit him more and more to
take the entire burden of responsibility.

When, in 1870, the wife fell asleep in Jesus, and Mr. Müller was himself
ill, he opened his heart to Mr. Wright as to the succession. Humility
led him to shrink from such a post, and his then wife feared it would
prove too burdensome for him; but all objections were overborne when it
was seen and felt to be God''s call. It was twenty-one months after this,
when, in November, 1871, Mr. Wright was married to Mr. Müller''s only
daughter and child, so that it is quite apparent that he had neither
sought the position he now occupies, nor was he appointed to it because
he was Mr. Müller''s son-in-law, for, at that time, his first wife was
living and in health. From May, 1872, therefore, Mr. Wright shared
with his father-in-law the responsibilities of the Institution, and gave
him great joy as a partner and successor in full sympathy with all the
great principles on which his work had been based.

A little over three years after Mr. Müller''s second marriage, in March,
1874, Mrs. Müller was taken ill, and became, two days later, feverish
and restless, and after about two weeks was attacked with hemorrhage
which brought her also very near to the gates of death. She rallied; but
fever and delirium followed and obstinate sleeplessness, till, for a
second time, she seemed at the point of death. Indeed so low was her
vitality that, as late as April 17th, a most experienced London
physician said that he had never known any patient to recover from such
an illness; and thus a third time all human hope of restoration seemed
gone. And yet, in answer to prayer, Mrs. Müller was raised up, and in
the end of May, was taken to the seaside for change of air, and grew
rapidly stronger until she was entirely restored. Thus the Lord spared
her to be the companion of her husband in those years of missionary
touring which enabled him to bear such worldwide witness. Out of the
shadow of his griefs this beloved man of God ever came to find that
divine refreshment which is as the "shadow of a great rock in a weary
land."

GOD''S real answers to prayer are often seeming denials. Beneath the
outward request He hears the voice of the inward desire, and He responds
to the mind of the Spirit rather than to the imperfect and perhaps
mistaken words in which the yearning seeks expression. Moreover, His
infinite wisdom sees that a larger blessing may be ours only by the
withholding of the lesser good which we seek; and so all true prayer
trusts Him to give His own answer, not in our way or time, or even to
our own expressed desire, but rather to His own unutterable groaning
within us which He can interpret better than we.

Monica, mother of Augustine, pleaded with God that her dissolute son
might not go to Rome, that sink of iniquity; but he was permitted to go,
and thus came into contact with Ambrose, bishop of Milan, through whom
he was converted. God fulfilled the mother''s desire while denying her
request.

When George Müller, five times within the first eight years after
conversion, had offered himself as a missionary, God had blocked his
way; now, at sixty-five, He was about to permit him, in a sense he had
never dreamed of, to be a missionary to the world. From the beginning of
his ministry he had been more or less an itinerant, spending no little
time in wanderings about in Britain and on the Continent; but now he was
to go to the regions beyond and spend the major part of seventeen years
in witnessing to the prayer-hearing God.

These extensive missionary tours occupied the evening of Mr. Müller''s
useful life, from 1875 to 1892. They reached, more or less, over Europe,
America, Asia, Africa, and Australia; and would of themselves have
sufficed for the work of an ordinary life.

They had a singular suggestion. While, in 1874, compelled by Mrs.
Müller''s health to seek a change of air, he was preaching in the Isle of
Wight, and a beloved Christian brother for whom he had spoken, himself a
man of much experience in preaching, told him how ''that day had been the
happiest of his whole life''; and this remark, with others like it
previously made, so impressed him that the Lord was about to use him to
help on believers outside of Bristol, that he determined no longer to
confine his labours in the Word and doctrine to any one place, but to go
wherever a door might open for his testimony.

1. To preach the gospel in its simplicity, and especially to show how
salvation is based, not upon feelings or even upon faith, but upon the
finished work of Christ; that justification is ours the moment we
believe, and we are to accept and claim our place as accepted in the
Beloved without regard to our inward states of feeling or emotion.

2. To lead believers to know their saved state, and to realize their
standing in Christ, great numbers not only of disciples, but even
preachers and pastors, being themselves destitute of any real peace and
joy in the Lord, and hence unable to lead others into joy and peace.

3. To bring believers back to the Scriptures, to search the Word and
find its hidden treasures; to test everything by this divine touchstone
and hold fast only what will stand this test; to make it the daily
subject of meditative and prayerful examination in order to translate it
into daily obedience.

4. To promote among all true believers, brotherly love; to lead them
to make less of those non-essentials in which disciples differ, and to
make more of those great essential and foundation truths in which all
true believers are united; to help all who love and trust one Lord to
rise above narrow sectarian prejudices, and barriers to fellowship.

5. To strengthen the faith of believers, encouraging a simpler trust,
and a more real and unwavering confidence in God, and particularly in
the sure answers to believing prayer, based upon His definite promises.

6. To promote separation from the world and deadness to it, and so to
increase heavenly-mindedness in children of God; at the same time
warning against fanatical extremes and extravagances, such as sinless
perfection while in the flesh.

7. And finally to fix the hope of disciples on the blessed coming of
our Lord Jesus; and, in connection therewith, to instruct them as to
the true character and object of the present dispensation, and the
relation of the church to the world in this period of the out-gathering
of the Bride of Christ.

These seven objects may be briefly epitomized thus: Mr. Müller''s aim was
to lead sinners to believe on the name of the Son of God, and so to
have eternal life; to help those who have thus believed, to know
that they have this life; to teach them so to build up themselves on
their most holy faith, by diligent searching into the word of God, and
praying in the Holy Ghost, as that this life shall be more and more a
real possession and a conscious possession; to promote among all
disciples the unity of the Spirit and the charity which is the bond
of perfectness, and to help them to exhibit that life before the world;
to incite them to cultivate an unworldly and spiritual type of
character such as conforms to the life of God in them; to lead them to
the prayer of faith which is both the expression and the expansion of
the life of faith; and to direct their hope to the final appearing of
the Lord, so that they should purify themselves even as He is pure, and
occupy till He comes. Mr. Müller was thus giving himself to the double
work of evangelization and edification, on a scale commensurate with his
love for a dying world, as opportunity afforded doing good unto all men,
and especially to them who are of the household of faith.

Of these long and busy missionary journeys, it is needful to give only
the outline, or general survey. March 263 1875, is an important date,
for it marks the starting-point. He himself calls this "the beginning of
his missionary tours."

From Bristol he went to Brighton, Lewes, and Sunderland—on the way to
Sunderland preaching to a great audience in the Metropolitan Tabernacle,
at Mr. Spurgeon''s request—then to Newcastle-on-Tyne, and back to London,
where he spoke at the Mildmay Park Conference, Talbot Road Tabernacle,
and ''Edinburgh Castle.'' This tour closed, June 5th, after seventy
addresses in public, during about ten weeks.

Less than six weeks passed, when, on August 14th, the second tour began,
in which case the special impulse that moved him was a desire to follow
up the revival work of Mr. Moody and Mr. Sankey. Their short stay in
each place made them unable to lead on new converts to higher
attainments in knowledge and grace, and there seemed to be a call for
some instruction fitted to confirm these new believers in the life of
obedience. Mr. Müller accordingly followed these evangelists in England,
Ireland, and Scotland, staying in each place from one week to six, and
seeking to educate and edify those who had been led to Christ. Among the
places visited on this errand in 1875, were London; then Kilmarnock,
Saltwater, Dundee, Perth, Glasgow, Kirkentilloch in Scotland, and Dublin
in Ireland; then, returning to England, he went to Leamington, Warwick,
Kenilworth, Coventry, Rugby, etc. In some cases, notably at Mildmay
Park, Dundee and Glasgow, Liverpool and Dublin, the audiences numbered
from two thousand to six thousand, but everywhere rich blessing came
from above. This second tour extended into the new year, 1876, and took
in Liverpool, York, Kendal, Carlisle, Annan, Edinburgh, Arbroath,
Montrose, Aberdeen, and other places; and when it closed in July, having
lasted nearly eleven months, Mr. Müller had preached at least three
hundred and six times, an average of about one sermon a day, exclusive
of days spent in travel. So acceptable and profitable were these labours
that there were over one hundred invitations urged upon him which he was
unable to accept.

The third tour was on the Continent. It occupied most of the year
closing May 26, 1877, and embraced Paris, various places in Switzerland,
Prussia and Holland, Alsace, Wurtemberg, Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, etc.
Altogether over three hundred addresses were given in about seventy
cities and villages to all of which he had been invited by letter. When
this tour closed more than sixty written invitations remained
unaccepted, and Mr. Müller found that, through his work and his
writings, he was as well known in the continental countries visited, as
in England.

Turning now toward America, the fourth tour extended from August, 1877,
to June of the next year. For many years invitations had been coming
with growing frequency, from the United States and Canada; and of late
their urgency led him to recognize in them the call of God, especially
as he thought of the many thousands of Germans across the Atlantic, who
as they heard him speak in their own native tongue would keep the more
silence. (Acts xxii. 2.)

Mr. and Mrs. Müller, landing at Quebec, thence went to the United
States, where, during ten months, his labours stretched over a vast
area, including the States of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Missouri. Thus having swept
round the Atlantic sea-border, he crossed to the Pacific coast, and
returning visited Salt Lake City in Utah—the very centre and stronghold
of Mormonism—Illinois, Ohio, etc. He spoke frequently to large
congregations of Germans, and, in the Southern States, to the coloured
population; but he regarded no opportunity for service afforded him on
this tour as so inspiring as the repeated meetings with and for
ministers, evangelists, pastors, and Christian workers; and, next to
them in importance, his interviews with large bodies of students and
professors in the universities, colleges, theological seminaries, and
other higher schools of education. To cast the salt of the gospel into
the very springs of social influence, the sources whence power flows,
was to him a most sacred privilege. His singular catholicity, charity,
and humility drew to him even those who differed with him, and all
denominations of Christians united in giving him access to the people.
During this tour he spoke three hundred times, and travelled nearly ten
thousand miles; over one hundred invitations being declined, for simple
lack of time and strength.

After a stay in Bristol of about two months, on September 5, 1878, he
and his wife began the fifth of these missionary tours. In this case, it
was on the Continent, where he ministered in English, German, and
French; and in Spain and Italy, when these tongues were not available,
his addresses were through an interpreter. Many open doors the Lord set
before him, not only to the poorer and humbler classes, but to those in
the middle and higher ranks. In the Riviera, he had access to many of
the nobility and aristocracy, who from different countries sought health
and rest in the equable climate of the Mediterranean, and at Mentone he
and Mr. Spurgeon held sweet converse. In Spain Mr. Müller was greatly
gladdened by seeing for himself the schools, entirely supported by the
funds of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, and by finding that, in
hundreds of cases, even popish parents so greatly valued these schools
that they continued to send their children, despite both the threats and
persuasions of the Romish priests. He found, moreover, that the pupils
frequently at their homes read to their parents the word of God and sang
to them the gospel hymns learned at these schools, so that the influence
exerted was not bounded by its apparent horizon, as diffused or
refracted sunlight reaches with its illumining rays far beyond the
visible track of the orb of day.

The work had to contend with governmental opposition. When a place was
first opened at Madrid for gospel services, a sign was placed outside,
announcing the fact. Official orders were issued that the sign should be
painted over, so as to obliterate the inscription. The painter of the
sign, unwilling both to undo his own work and to hinder the work of God,
painted the sign over with water-colours, which would leave the original
announcement half visible, and would soon be washed off by the rains;
whereupon the government sent its own workman to daub the sign over with
thick oil-colour.

Mr. Müller, ready to preach the gospel to those at Rome also, felt his
spirit saddened and stirred within him, as he saw that city wholly given
to idolatry—not pagan but papal idolatry—the Rome not of the Caesars,
but of the popes. While at Naples he ascended Vesuvius. Those masses of
lava, which seemed greater in bulk than the mountain itself, more
impressed him with the power of God than anything else he had ever seen.
As he looked upon that smoking cone, and thought of the liquid death it
had vomited forth, he said within himself, "What cannot God do!" He had
before felt somewhat of His Almightiness in love and grace, but he now
saw its manifestation in judgment and wrath. His visit to the Vaudois
valleys, where so many martyrs had suffered banishment and imprisonment,
loss of goods and loss of life for Jesus'' sake, moved him to the depths
of his being and stimulated in him the martyr spirit.

When he arrived again in Bristol, June 18, 1879, he had been absent nine
months and twelve days, and preached two hundred and eighty-six times
and in forty-six towns and cities. After another ten weeks in Bristol,
he and his wife sailed again for America, the last week of August, 1879,
landing at New York the first week in September. This visit took in the
States lying between the Atlantic Ocean and the valley of the
Mississippi—New York and New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and
Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota—and, from London and Hamilton to
Quebec, Canada also shared the blessing. This visit covered only two
hundred and seventy-two days, but he preached three hundred times, and
in over forty cities. Over one hundred and fifty written invitations
still remained without response, and the number increased the longer his
stay. Mr. Müller therefore assuredly gathered that the Lord called him
to return to America, after another brief stay at Bristol, where he felt
it needful to spend a season annually, to keep in close touch with the
work at home and relieve Mr. and Mrs. Wright of their heavy
responsibilities, for a time.

Accordingly on September 15, 1880, again turning from Bristol, these
travellers embarked the next day on their seventh mission tour, landing,
ten days later, at Quebec. Mr. Müller had a natural antipathy to the
sea, in his earlier crossing to the Continent having suffered much from
sea-sickness; but he had undertaken these long voyages, not for his own
pleasure or profit, but wholly on God''s errand; and he felt it to be a
peculiar mark of the loving-kindness of the Lord that, while he was
ready to endure any discomfort, or risk his life for His sake, he had
not in his six crossings of the Atlantic suffered in the least, and on
this particular voyage was wholly free from any indisposition.

From Quebec he went to Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania. Among other places of special interest were Boston,
Plymouth—the landing-place of the Pilgrims,—Wellesley and South Hadley
colleges—the great schools for woman''s higher education,—and the
centres farther westward, where he had such wide access to Germans. This
tour extended over a smaller area than before, and lasted but eight
months; but the impression on the people was deep and permanent. He had
spoken about two hundred and fifty times in all; and Mrs. Müller had
availed herself of many opportunities of personal dealing with
inquirers, and of distributing books and tracts among both believers and
unbelievers. She had also written for her husband more than seven
hundred letters,—this of itself being no light task, inasmuch as it
reaches an average of about three a day. On May 30, 1881, they were
again on British shores.

The eighth long preaching tour, from August 23, 1881, to May 30, 1882,
was given to the Continent of Europe, where again Mr. Müller felt led by
the low state of religious life in Switzerland and Germany.

This visit was extended to the Holy Land in a way strikingly
providential. After speaking at Alexandria, Cairo, and Port Said, he
went to Jaffa, and thence to Jerusalem, on November 28. With reverent
feet he touched the soil once trodden by the feet of the Son of God,
visiting, with pathetic interest, Gethsemane and Golgotha, and crossing
the Mount of Olives to Bethany, thence to Bethlehem and back to Jaffa,
and so to Haipha, Mt. Carmel, and Beirut, Smyrna, Ephesus,
Constantinople, Athens, Brindisi, Rome, and Florence. Again were months
crowded with services of all sorts whose fruit will appear only in the
Day of the Lord Jesus, addresses being made in English, German, and
French, or by translation into Arabic, Armenian, Turkish, and modern
Greek. Sightseeing was always but incidental to the higher service of
the Master. During this eighth tour, covering some eight months, Mr.
Müller spoke hundreds of times, with all the former tokens of God''s
blessing on his seed-sowing.

The ninth tour, from August 8, 1882, to June 1, 1883, was occupied
with labours in Germany, Austria, and Russia, including Bavaria,
Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, and Poland. His special joy it was to bear
witness in Kroppenstadt, his birthplace, after an absence of about
sixty-four years. At St. Petersburg, while the guest of Princess Lieven,
at her mansion he met and ministered to many of high rank; he also began
to hold meetings in the house of Colonel Paschkoff, who had suffered not
only persecution but exile for the Lord''s sake. While the Scriptures
were being read one day in Buss, with seven poor Russians, a policeman
summarily broke up the meeting and dispersed the little company. At Lodz
in Poland, a letter was received, in behalf of almost the whole
population begging him to remain longer; and so signs seemed to
multiply, as he went forward, that he was in the path of duty and that
God was with him.

On September 26, 1883, the tenth tour began, this time his face being
turned toward the Orient. Nearly sixty years before he had desired to go
to the East Indies as a missionary; now the Lord permitted him to carry
out the desire in a new and strange way, and India was the
twenty-third country visited in his tours. He travelled over 21,000
miles, and spoke over two hundred times, to missionaries and Christian
workers, European residents, Eurasians, Hindus, Moslems, educated
natives, native boys and girls in the orphanage at Colar, etc. Thus, in
his seventy-ninth year, this servant of God was still in labours
abundant, and in all his work conspicuously blessed of God.

After some months of preaching in England, Scotland, and Wales, on
November 19, 1885, he and his wife set out on their fourth visit to the
United States, and their eleventh longer mission tour. Crossing to the
Pacific, they went to Sydney, New South Wales, and, after seven months
in Australia, sailed for Java, and thence to China, arriving at Hong
Kong, September 12th; Japan and the Straits of Malacca were also
included in this visit to the Orient. The return to England was by way
of Nice; and, after travelling nearly 38,000 miles, in good health Mr.
and Mrs. Müller reached home on June 14, 1887, having been absent more
than one year and seven months, during which Mr. Müller had preached
whenever and wherever opportunity was afforded.

Less than two months later, on August 12, 1887, he sailed for South
Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Ceylon, and India. This twelfth long
tour closed in March, 1890, having covered thousands of miles. The
intense heat at one time compelled Mr. Müller to leave Calcutta, and on
the railway journey to Darjeeling his wife feared he would die. But he
was mercifully spared.

It was on this tour and in the month of January, 1890, while at
Jubbulpore, preaching with great help from the Lord, that a letter was
put into Mr. Müller''s hands, from a missionary at Agra, to whom Mr.
Wright had sent a telegram, informing his father-in-law of his dear
Lydia''s death. For nearly thirty years she had laboured gratuitously at
the orphan houses and it would he difficult to fill that vacancy; but
for fourteen years she had been her husband''s almost ideal companion,
and for nearly fifty-eight years her father''s unspeakable treasure—and
here were two other voids which could never be filled. But Mr. Müller''s
heart, as also Mr. Wright''s, was kept at rest by the strong confidence
that, however mysterious God''s ways, all His dealings belong to one
harmonious spiritual mechanism in which every part is perfect and all
things work together for good. (Romans viii. 28.)

This sudden bereavement led Mr. Müller to bring his mission tour in the
East to a close and depart for Bristol, that he might both comfort Mr.
Wright and relieve him of undue pressure of work.

After a lapse of two months, once more Mr. and Mrs. Müller left home for
other extensive missionary journeys. They went to the Continent and were
absent from July, 1890, to May, 1892. A twelvemonth was spent in Germany
and Holland, Austria and Italy. This absence in fact included two tours,
with no interval between them, and concluded the series of extensive
journeys reaching through seventeen years.

This man—from his seventieth to his eighty-seventh year—when most men
are withdrawing from all activities, had travelled in forty-two
countries and over two hundred thousand miles, a distance equivalent to
nearly eight journeys round the globe! He estimated that during these
seventeen years he had addressed over three million people; and from all
that can be gathered from the records of these tours, we estimate that
he must have spoken, outside of Bristol, between five thousand and six
thousand times. What sort of teaching and testimony occupied these
tours, those who have known the preacher and teacher need not be told.
While at Berlin in 1891, he gave an address that serves as an example of
the vital truths which he was wont to press on the attention of fellow
disciples. We give a brief outline:

He first urged that believers should never, even under the greatest
difficulties, be discouraged, and gave for his position sound scriptural
reasons. Then he pointed out to them that the chief business of every
day is first of all to seek to be truly at rest and happy in God. Then
he showed how, from the word of God, all saved believers may know their
true standing in Christ, and how in circumstances of particular
perplexity they might ascertain the will of God. He then urged disciples
to seek with intense earnestness to become acquainted with God Himself
as revealed in the Holy Scriptures, and carefully to form and maintain
godly habits of systematic Bible study and prayer, holy living and
consecrated giving. He taught that God alone is the one all-satisfying
portion of the soul, and that we must determine to possess and enjoy Him
as such. He closed by emphasizing it as the one, single, all-absorbing,
daily aim to glorify God in a complete surrender to His will and
service.

In all these mission tours, again, the faithfulness of God
conspicuously seen, in the bounteous supply of every need. Steamer fares
and long railway journeys; hotel accommodations, ordinarily preferred to
private hospitality, which seriously interfered with private habits of
devotion, public work, and proper rest—such expenses demanded a heavy
outlay; the new mode of life, now adopted for the Lord''s sake, was at
least three times as costly as the former frugal housekeeping; and yet,
in answer to prayer and without any appeal to human help, the Lord
furnished all that was required.

Accustomed to look, step by step, for such tokens of divine approval, as
emboldened him to go forward, Mr. Müller records how, when one hundred
pounds was sent to him for personal uses, this was recognized as a
foretoken from his great Provider, "by which," he writes, "God meant to
say to my own heart, ''I am pleased with thy work and service in going
about on these long missionary tours. I will pay the expenses thereof,
and I give thee here a specimen of what I am yet willing to do for
thee.''"

Two other facts Mr. Müller specially records in connection with these
tours: first, God''s gracious guiding and guarding of the work at Bristol
so that it suffered nothing from his absence; and secondly, the fact
that these journeys had no connection with collecting of money for the
work or even informing the public of it. No reference was made to the
Institution at Bristol, except when urgently requested, and not always
even then; nor were collections ever made for it. Statements found their
way into the press that in America large sums were gathered, but their
falsity is sufficiently shown by the fact that in his first tour in
America, for example, the sum total of all such gifts was less than
sixty pounds, not more than two thirds of the outlay of every day at the
orphan houses.

These missionary tours were not always approved even by the friends and
advisers of Mr. Müller. In 1882, while experiencing no little difficulty
and trial, especially as to funds, there were not a few who felt a deep
interest in the Institution on Ashley Down, who would have had God''s
servant discontinue his long absences, as to them it appeared that these
were the main reason for the falling off in funds. He was always open to
counsel, but he always reserved to himself an independent decision; and,
on weighing the matter well, these were some of the reasons that led him
to think that the work of God at home did not demand his personal
presence:

1. He had observed year after year that, under the godly and efficient
supervision of Mr. Wright and his large staff of helpers, every branch
of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution had been found as healthy and
fruitful during these absences as when Mr. Müller was in Bristol.

2. The Lord''s approval of this work of wider witness had been in manner
conclusive and in measure abundant, as in the ample supply of funds for
these tours, in the wide doors of access opened, and in the large fruit
already evident in blessing to thousands of souls.

3. The strong impression upon his mind that this was the work which was
to occupy the ''evening of his life,'' grew in depth, and was confirmed by
so many signs of God''s leading that he could not doubt that he was led
both of God''s providence and Spirit.

4. Even while absent, he was never out of communication with the helpers
at home. Generally he heard at least weekly from Mr. Wright, and any
matters needing his counsel were thus submitted to him by letter; prayer
to God was as effectual at a distance from Bristol as on the spot; and
his periodical returns to that city for some weeks or months between
these tours kept him in close touch with every department of the work.

5. The supreme consideration, however, was this: To suppose it necessary
for Mr. Müller himself to be at home in order that sufficient means
should be supplied, was a direct contradiction of the very principles
upon which, and to maintain which, the whole work had been begun. Real
trust in God is above circumstances and appearances. And this had been
proven; for, during the third year after these tours began, the income
for the various departments of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution was
larger than ever during the preceding forty-four years of its existence;
and therefore, notwithstanding the loving counsel of a few donors and
friends who advised that Mr. Müller should stay at home, he kept to his
purpose and his principles, partly to demonstrate that no man''s presence
is indispensable to the work of the Lord. "Them that honour Me I will
honour." (1 Samuel ii. 39.) He regarded it the greatest honour of his
life to bear this wide witness to God, and God correspondingly honoured
His servant in bearing this testimony.

It was during the first and second of these American tours that the
writer had the privilege of coming into personal contact with Mr.
Müller. While I was at San Francisco, in 1878, he was to speak on
Sabbath afternoon, May 12th, at Oakland, just across the bay, but
conscientious objections to needless Sunday travel caused me voluntarily
to lose what then seemed the only chance of seeing and hearing a man
whose career had been watched by me for over twenty years, as he was to
leave for the East a few days earlier than myself and was likely to be
always a little in advance. On reaching Ogden, however, where the branch
road from Salt Lake City joins the main line, Mr. and Mrs. Müller
boarded my train and we travelled to Chicago together. I introduced
myself, and held with him daily converse about divine things, and, while
tarrying at Chicago, had numerous opportunities for hearing him speak
there.

The results of this close and frequent contact were singularly blessed
to me, and at my invitation he came to Detroit, Michigan, in his next
tour, and spoke in the Fort Street Presbyterian Church, of which I was
pastor, on Sundays, January 18 and 25, 1880, and on Monday and Friday
evenings, in the interval.

In addition to these numerous and favourable opportunities thus
providentially afforded for hearing and conversing with Mr. Müller, he
kindly met me for several days in my study, for an hour at a time, for
conference upon those deeper truths of the word of God and deeper
experiences of the Christian life, upon which I was then very desirous
of more light. For example, I desired to understand more clearly the
Bible teaching about the Lord''s coming. I had opposed with much
persistency what is known as the premillennial view, and brought out my
objections, to all of which he made one reply: "My beloved brother, I
have heard all your arguments and objections against this view, but they
have one fatal defect: not one of them is based upon the word of God.
You will never get at the truth upon any matter of divine revelation
unless you lay aside your prejudices and like a little child ask simply
what is the testimony of Scripture."

With patience and wisdom he unravelled the tangled skein of my
perplexity and difficulty, and helped me to settle upon biblical
principles all matters of so-called expediency. As he left me, about to
visit other cities, his words fixed themselves in my memory. I had
expressed to him my growing conviction that the worship in the churches
had lost its primitive simplicity; that the pew-rent system was
pernicious; that fixed salaries for ministers of the gospel were
unscriptural; that the church of God should be administered only by men
full of the Holy Ghost, and that the duty of Christians to the
non-church-going masses was grossly neglected, etc. He solemnly said to
me: "My beloved brother, the Lord has given you much light upon these
matters, and will hold you correspondingly responsible for its use. If
you obey Him and walk in the light, you will have more; if not, the
light will be withdrawn."

It is a singular lesson on the importance of an anointed tongue, that
forty simple words, spoken over twenty years ago, have had a daily
influence on the life of him to whom they were spoken. Amid subtle
temptations to compromise the claims of duty and hush the voice of
conscience, or of the Spirit of God, and to follow the traditions of men
rather than the word of God, those words of that venerated servant of
God have recurred to mind with ever fresh force. We risk the forfeiture
of privileges which are not employed for God, and of obscuring
convictions which are not carried into action. God''s word to us is "use
or lose." "To him that hath shall be given: from him that hath not
shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have." It is the hope
and the prayer of him who writes this memoir that the reading of these
pages may prove to be an interview with the man whose memorial they are,
and that the witness borne by George Müller may be to many readers a
source of untold and lifelong blessing.

It need not be said that to carry out conviction into action is a costly
sacrifice. It may make necessary renunciations and separations which
leave one to feel a strange sense both of deprivation and loneliness.
But he who will fly as an eagle does into the higher levels where
cloudless day abides, and live in the sunshine of God, must consent to
live a comparatively lonely life. No bird is so solitary as the eagle.
Eagles never fly in flocks: one, or at most two, and the two, mates,
being ever seen at once. But the life that is lived unto God, however it
forfeits human companionship, knows divine fellowship, and the child of
God who like his Master undertakes to "do always the things that please
Him," can like his Master say, "The Father hath not left me alone." "I
am alone; yet not alone, for the Father is with me." Whosoever will
promptly follow whatever light God gives, without regard to human
opinion, custom, tradition, or approbation, will learn the deep meaning
of these words: "Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord."

QUANTITY of service is of far less importance than quality. To do well,
rather than to do much, will be the motto of him whose main purpose is
to please God. Our Lord bade His disciples tarry until endued with power
from on high, because it is such enduement that gives to all witness and
work the celestial savour and flavour of the Spirit.

Before we come to the closing scenes, we may well look back over the
life-work of George Müller, which happily illustrates both quantity and
quality of service. It may be doubted whether any other one man of this
century accomplished as much for God and man, and yet all the abundant
offerings which he brought to his Master were characterized by a
heavenly fragrance.

The orphan work was but one branch of that tree—the Scriptural
Knowledge Institution—which owed its existence to the fact that its
founder devised large and liberal things for the Lord''s cause. He sought
to establish or at least to aid Christian schools wherever needful, to
scatter Bibles and Testaments, Christian books and tracts; to aid
missionaries who were witnessing to the truth and working on a
scriptural basis in destitute parts; and though each of these objects
might well have engrossed his mind, they were all combined in the
many-sided work which his love for souls suggested.

An aggressive spirit is never content with what has been done, but is
prompt to enter any new door that is providentially opened. When the
Paris Exposition of 1867 offered such rare opportunities, both for
preaching to the crowds passing through the French capital, and for
circulating among them the Holy Scriptures, he gladly availed himself of
the services of two brethren whom God had sent to labour there, one of
whom spoke three, and the other, eight, modern languages; and through
them were circulated, chiefly at the Exposition, and in thirteen
different languages, nearly twelve thousand copies of the word of God,
or portions of the same. It has been estimated that at this
International Exhibition there were distributed in all over one and a
quarter million Bibles, in sixteen tongues, which were gratefully
accepted, even by Romish priests. Within six months those who thus
entered God''s open door scattered more copies of the Book of God than in
ordinary circumstances would have been done by ten thousand colporteurs
in twenty times that number of months, and thousands of souls are known
to have found salvation by the simple reading of the New Testament. Of
this glorious work, George Müller was permitted to be so largely a
promoter.

At the Havre Exhibition of the following year, 1868, a similar work was
done; and in like manner, when a providential door was unexpectedly
opened into the Land of the Inquisition, Mr. Müller promptly took
measures to promote the circulation of the Word in Spain. In the
streets of Madrid the open Bible was seen for the first time, and
copies were sold at the rate of two hundred and fifty in an hour, so
that the supply was not equal to the demand. The same facts were
substantially repeated when free Italy furnished a field for sowing the
seed of the Kingdom. This wide-awake servant of God watched the signs of
the times and, while others slept, followed the Lord''s signals of
advance.

One of the most fascinating features of the Narrative is found in the
letters from his Bible distributors. It is interesting also to trace the
story of the growth of the tract enterprise, until, in 1874, the
circulation exceeded three and three-quarter millions, God in His
faithfulness supplying abundant means.*

The good thus effected by the distributors of evangelical literature
must not be overlooked in this survey of the many useful agencies
employed or assisted by Mr. Müller. To him the world was a field to be
sown with the seed of the Kingdom, and opportunities were eagerly
embraced for widely disseminating the truth. Tracts were liberally used,
given away in large quantities at open-air services, fairs, races and
steeplechases, and among spectators at public executions, or among
passengers on board ships and railway trains, and by the way. Sometimes,
at a single gathering of the multitudes, fifteen thousand were
distributed judiciously and prayerfully, and this branch of the work
has, during all these years, continued with undiminished fruitfulness to
yield its harvest of good.

All this was, from first to last, and of necessity, a work of faith. How
far faith must have been kept in constant and vigorous exercise can be
appreciated only by putting one''s self in Mr. Müller''s place. In the
year 1874, for instance, about forty-four thousand pounds were needed,
and he was compelled to count the cost and face the situation. Two
thousand and one hundred hungry mouths were daily to be fed, and as many
bodies to be clad and cared for. One hundred and eighty-nine
missionaries were needing assistance; one hundred schools, with about
nine thousand pupils, to be supported; four million pages of tracts and
tens of thousands of copies of the Scriptures to be yearly provided for
distribution; and, beside all these ordinary expenses, inevitable crises
or emergencies, always liable to arise in connection with the conduct of
such extensive enterprises, would from time to time call for
extraordinary outlay. The man who was at the head of the Scriptural
Knowledge Institution had to look at this array of unavoidable expenses,
and at the same time face the human possibility and probability of an
empty treasury whence the last shilling had been drawn. Let him tell us
how he met such a prospect: "God, our infinitely rich Treasurer, remains
to us. It is this which gives me peace.... Invariably, with this
probability before me, I have said to myself: ''God who has raised up
this work through me; God who has led me generally year after year to
enlarge it; God, who has supported this work now for more than forty
years, will still help and will not suffer me to be confounded, because
I rely upon Him. I commit the whole work to Him, and He will provide me
with what I need, in future also, though I know not whence the means are
to come.''"*

Thus he wrote in his journal, on July 28, 1874. Since then twenty-four
years have passed, and to this day the work goes on, though he who then
had the guidance of it sleeps in Jesus. Whoever has had any such
dealings with God, on however small a scale, cannot even think of the
Lord as failing to honour a faith so simple, genuine, and childlike a
faith which leads a helpless believer thus to cast himself and all his
cares upon God with utter abandonment of all anxiety. This man put God
to proof, and proved to himself and to all who receive his testimony
that it is blessed to wait only upon Him. The particular point which he
had in view, in making these entries in his journal is the object also
of embodying them in these pages, namely, to show that, while the annual
expenses of this Institution were so exceedingly large and the income so
apparently uncertain, the soul of this believer was, to use his own
words, "THROUGHOUT, without the least wavering, stayed upon God,
believing that He who had through him begun the Institution, enlarged it
almost year after year, and upheld it for forty years in answer to
prayer by faith, would do this still and not suffer this servant of His
to be confounded."* Believing that God would still help, and supply the
means, George Müller was willing, and THOROUGHLY in heart prepared, if
necessary, to pass again through similar severe and prolonged seasons of
trial as he had already endured.

The Living God had kept him calm and restful, amid all the ups and downs
of his long experience as the superintendent and director of this
many-sided work, though the tests of faith had not been light or short
of duration. For more than ten years at a time—as from August, 1838, to
April, 1849, day by day, and for months together from meal to meal—it
was necessary to look to God, almost without cessation, for daily
supplies. When, later on, the Institution was twentyfold larger and the
needs proportionately greater, for months at a time the Lord likewise
constrained His servant to lean from hour to hour, in the same
dependence, upon Him. All along through these periods of unceasing want,
the Eternal God was his refuge and underneath were the Everlasting Arms.
He reflected that God was aware of all this enlargement of the work and
its needs; he comforted himself with the consoling thought that he was
seeking his Master''s glory; and that if in this way the greater glory
would accrue to Him for the good of His people and of those who were
still unbelievers, it was no concern of the servant; nay, more than
this, it behooved the servant to be willing to go on in this path of
trial, even unto the end of his course, if so it should please his
Master, who guides His affairs with divine discretion.

The trials of faith did not cease even until the end. July 28, 1881,
finds the following entry in Mr. Müller''s journal:

"The income has been for some time past only about a third part of the
expenses. Consequently all we have for the support of the orphans is
nearly gone; and for the first four objects of the Institution we have
nothing at all in hand. The natural appearance now is that the work
cannot be carried on. But I BELIEVE that the Lord will help, both with
means for the orphans and also for other objects of the Institution, and
that we shall not be confounded; also that the work shall not need to be
given up. I am fully expecting help, and have written this to the glory
of God, that it may be recorded hereafter for the encouragement of His
children. The result will be seen. I expect that we shall not be
confounded, though for some years we have not been so poor."

While faith thus leaned on God, prayer took more vigorous hold. Six,
seven, eight times a day, he and his dear wife were praying for means,
looking for answers, and firmly persuaded that their expectations would
not be disappointed. Since that entry was made, seventeen more years
have borne their witness that this trust was not put to shame. Not a
branch of this tree of holy enterprise has been cut off by the sharp
blade of a stern necessity.

Though faith had thus tenaciously held fast to the promises, the
pressure was not at once relieved. When, a fortnight after these
confident records of trust in God had been spread on the pages of the
journal, the balance for the orphans was less than it had been for
twenty-five years, it would have seemed to human sight as though God had
forgotten to be gracious. But, on August 22nd, over one thousand pounds
came in for the support of the orphans and thus relief was afforded for
a time.

Again, let us bear in mind how in the most unprecedented straits God
alone was made the confidant, even the best friends of the Institution,
alike the poor and the rich, being left in ignorance of the pressure of
want. It would have been no sin to have made known the circumstances, or
even to have made an appeal for aid to the many believers who would
gladly have come to the relief of the work. But the testimony to the
Lord was to be jealously guarded, and the main object of this work of
faith would have been imperilled just so far as by any appeal to men
this witness to God was weakened.

In this crisis, and in every other, faith triumphed, and so the
testimony to a prayer-hearing God grew in volume and power as the years
went on. It was while as yet this period of testing was not ended, and
no permanent relief was yet supplied, that Mr. Müller, with his wife,
left Bristol on August 23rd, for the Continent, on his eighth long
preaching tour. Thus, at a time when, to the natural eye, his own
presence would have seemed well-nigh indispensable, he calmly departed
for other spheres of duty, leaving the work at home in the hands of Mr.
Wright and his helpers. The tour had been already arranged for, under
God''s leading, and it was undertaken, with the supporting power of a
deep conviction that God is as near to those who in prayer wait on Him
in distant lands, as on Ashley Down, and needs not the personal presence
of any man in any one place, or at any time, in order to carry on His
work.

In an American city, a half-idiotic boy who was bearing a heavy burden
asked a drayman, who was driving an empty cart, for a ride. Being
permitted, he mounted the cart with his basket, but thinking he might so
relieve the horse a little, while still himself riding, lifted his load
and carried it. We laugh at the simplicity of the idiotic lad, and yet
how often we are guilty of similar folly! We profess to cast ourselves
and our cares upon the Lord, and then persist in bearing our own
burdens, as if we felt that He would be unequal to the task of
sustaining us and our loads. It is a most wholesome lesson for Christian
workers to learn that all true work is primarily the Lord''s, and only
secondarily ours, and that therefore all ''carefulness'' on our part is
distrust of Him, implying a sinful self-conceit which overlooks the fact
that He is the one Worker and all others are only His instruments.

As to our trials, difficulties, losses, and disappointments, we are
prone to hesitate about committing them to the Lord, trustfully and
calmly. We think we have done well if we take refuge in the Lord''s
promise to his reluctant disciple Peter, "What I do thou knowest not
now, but thou shalt know hereafter," referring this ''hereafter'' to the
future state where we look for the solution of all problems. In Peter''s
case the hereafter appears to have come when the feet-washing was done
and Christ explained its meaning; and it is very helpful to our faith to
observe Mr. Müller''s witness concerning all these trying and
disappointing experiences of his life, that, without one exception, he
had found already in this life that they worked together for his good;
so that he had reason to praise God for them all. In the ninetieth psalm
we read:

"Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us
      And the years wherein we have seen evil."
            (Psalm xc. 15.)

This is an inspired prayer, and such prayer is a prophecy. Not a few
saints have found, this side of heaven, a divine gladness for every year
and day of sadness, when their afflictions and adversities have been
patiently borne.

Faith is the secret of both peace and steadfastness, amid all tendencies
to discouragement and discontinuance in well-doing. James was led by the
Spirit of God to write that the unstable and unbelieving man is like the
"wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed." There are two motions
of the waves—one up and down, which we call undulation, the other to
and fro, which we call fluctuation. How appropriately both are referred
to—"tossed" up and down, "driven" to and fro! The double-minded man
lacks steadiness in both respects: his faith has no uniformity of
experience, for he is now at the crest of the wave and now in the trough
of the sea; it has no uniformity of progress, for whatever he gains
to-day he loses to-morrow.

Fluctuations in income and apparent prosperity did not take George
Müller by surprise. He expected them, for if there were no crises and
critical emergencies how could there be critical deliverances? His trust
was in God, not in donors or human friends or worldly circumstances: and
because he trusted in the Living God who says of Himself, "I am the
Lord, I change not," amid all other changes, his feet were upon the one
Rock of Ages that no earthquake shock can move from its eternal
foundations.

First. "For above fifty years I have now walked, by His grace, in a path
of complete reliance upon Him who is the faithful one, for everything I
have needed; and yet I am increasingly convinced that it is by His help
alone I am enabled to continue in this course; for, if left to myself,
even after the precious enjoyment so long experienced of walking thus in
fellowship with God, I should yet be tempted to abandon this path of
entire dependence upon Him. To His praise, however, I am able to state
that for more than half a century I have never had the least desire to
do so."

Second. From May, 1880, to May 1881, a gracious work of the Spirit had
visited the orphans on Ashley Down and in many of the schools. During
the three months spent by Mr. Müller at home before sailing for America
in September, 1880, he had been singularly drawn out in prayer for such
a visitation of grace, and had often urged it on the prayers of his
helpers. The Lord is faithful, and He cheered the heart of His servant
in his absence by abundant answers to his intercessions. Before he had
fairly entered on his work in America, news came from home of a blessed
work of conversion already in progress, and which went on for nearly a
year, until there was good ground for believing that in the five houses
five hundred and twelve orphans had found God their Father in Christ,
and nearly half as many more were in a hopeful state.

The Lord did not forget His promise, and He did keep the plant He had
permitted His servant to set in His name in the soil on Ashley Down.
Faith that was tried, triumphed. On June 7, 1884, a legacy of over
eleven thousand pounds reached him, the largest single gift ever yet
received, the largest donations which had preceded being respectively
one thousand, two thousand, three thousand, five thousand, eight
thousand one hundred, and nine thousand and ninety-one pounds.

This last amount, eleven thousand, had been due for over six years from
an estate, but had been kept back by the delays of the Chancery Court.
Prayer had been made day by day that the bequest might be set free for
its uses, and now the full answer had come; and God had singularly timed
the supply to the need, for there was at that time only forty-one pounds
ten shillings in hand, not one half of the average daily expenses, and
certain sanitary improvements were just about to be carried out which
would require an outlay of over two thousand pounds.

"Thus ended the year 1884, during which we had been tried, greatly
tried, in various ways, no doubt for the exercise of our faith, and to
make us know God more fully; but during which we had also been helped
and blessed, and greatly helped and blessed. Peacefully, then, we were
able to enter upon the year 1885, fully assured that, as we had God FOR
us and WITH us, ALL, ALL would be well." John Wesley had in the same
spirit said a century before, "Best of all, God is with us."

Of late years the orphanage at Ashley Down has not had as many inmates
as formerly, and some four or five hundred more might now be received.
Mr. MUller felt constrained, for some years previous to his death, to
make these vacancies known to the public, in hopes that some destitute
orphans might find there a home. But it must be remembered that the
provision for such children has been greatly enlarged since this orphan
work was begun. In 1834 the total accommodation for all orphans, in
England, reached thirty-six hundred, while the prisons contained nearly
twice as many children under eight years of age. This state of things
led to the rapid enlargement of the work until over two thousand were
housed on Ashley Down alone; and this colossal enterprise stimulated
others to open similar institutions until, fifty years after Mr. Müller
began his work, at least one hundred thousand orphans were cared for in
England alone. Thus God used Mr. Müller to give such an impetus to this
form of philanthropy, that destitute children became the object of a
widely organized charity both on the part of individuals and of
societies, and orphanages now exist for various classes.

In all this manifold work which Mr. Müller did he was, to the last,
self-oblivious. From the time when, in October, 1830, he had given up
all stated salary, as pastor and minister of the gospel, he had never
received any salary, stipend nor fixed income, of any sort, whether as a
pastor or as a director of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution. Both
principle and preference led him to wait only upon God for all personal
needs, as also for all the wants of his work. Nevertheless God put into
the hearts of His believing children in all parts of the world, not only
to send gifts in aid of the various branches of the work which Mr.
Müller superintended, but to forward to him money for his own uses, as
well as clothes, food, and other temporal supplies. He never
appropriated one penny which was not in some way indicated or designated
as for his own personal needs, and subject to his personal judgment. No
straits of individual or family want ever led him to use, even for a
time, what was sent to him for other ends. Generally gifts intended for
himself were wrapped up in paper with his name written thereon, or in
other equally distinct ways designated as meant for him. Thus as early
as 1874 his year''s income reached upwards of twenty-one hundred pounds.
Few nonconformist ministers, and not one in twenty of the clergy of the
establishment, have any such income, which averages about six pounds for
every day in the year—and all this came from the Lord, simply in answer
to prayer, and without appeal of any sort to man or even the revelation
of personal needs. If we add legacies paid at the end of the year 1873,
Mr. Müller''s entire income in about thirteen months exceeded thirty-one
hundred pounds. Of this he gave, out and out to the needy, and to the
work of God, the whole amount save about two hundred and fifty, expended
on personal and family wants; and thus started the year 1875 as poor as
he had begun forty-five years before; and if his personal expenses were
scrutinized it would be found that even what he ate and drank and wore
was with equal conscientiousness expended for the glory of God, so that
in a true sense we may say he spent nothing on himself.

In another connection it has already been recorded that, when at
Jubbulpore in 1890, Mr. Müller received tidings of his daughter''s death.
To any man of less faith that shock might have proved, at his advanced
age, not only a stunning but a fatal blow. His only daughter and only
child, Lydia, the devoted wife of James Wright, had been called home, in
her fifty-eighth year, and after nearly thirty years of labour at the
orphan houses. What this death meant to Mr. Müller, at the age of
eighty-four, no one can know who has not witnessed the mutual devotion
of that daughter and that father: and what that loss was to Mr. Wright,
the pen alike fails to portray. If the daughter seemed to her father
humanly indispensable, she was to her husband a sort of inseparable part
of his being; and over such experiences as these it is the part of
delicacy to draw the curtain of silence. But it should be recorded that
no trait in Mrs. Wright was more pathetically attractive than her
humility. Few disciples ever felt their own nothingness as she did, and
it was this ornament of a meek and quiet spirit—the only ornament she
wore—that made her seem so beautiful to all who knew her well enough
for this ''hidden man of the heart'' to be disclosed to their vision. Did
not that ornament in the Lord''s sight appear as of great price? Truly
"the beauty of the Lord her God was upon her."

James Wright had lived with his beloved Lydia for more than eighteen
years, in "unmarred and unbroken felicity." They had together shared in
prayers and tears before God, bearing all life''s burdens in common. Weak
as she was physically, he always leaned upon her and found her a tower
of spiritual strength in time of heavy responsibility. While, in her
lowly-mindedness, she thought of herself as a ''little useless thing,'' he
found her both a capable and cheerful supervisor of many most important
domestic arrangements where a competent woman''s hand was needful: and,
with rare tact and fidelity, she kept watch of the wants of the orphans
as her dear mother had done before her. After her decease, her husband
found among her personal effects a precious treasure—a verse written
with her own hand:

"I have seen the face of Jesus,
        Tell me not of aught beside;
        I have heard the voice of Jesus,
        All my soul is satisfied."

This invaluable little fragment, like that other writing found by this
beloved daughter among her mother''s effects, became to Mr. Wright what
that had been to Mr. Müller, a sort of last legacy from his departed and
beloved wife. Her desires were fulfilled; she had seen the face and
heard the voice of Him who alone could satisfy her soul.

In the Fifty-third Report, which extends to May 26, 1892, it is stated
that the expenses exceeded the income for the orphans by a total of over
thirty-six hundred pounds, so that many dear fellow labourers, without
the least complaint, were in arrears as to salaries. This was the second
time only, in fifty-eight years, that the income thus fell short of the
expenses. Ten years previous, the expenses had been in excess of the
income by four hundred and eighty-eight pounds, but, within one month
after the new financial year had begun, by the payment of legacies three
times as much as the deficiency was paid in; and, adding donations, six
times as much. And now the question arose whether God would not have Mr.
Müller contract rather than expand the work.

He says: "The Lord''s dealings with us during the last year indicate that
it is His will we should contract our operations, and we are waiting
upon Him for directions as to how and to what extent this should be
done; for we have but one single object—the glory of God. When I
founded this Institution, one of the principles stated was, ''that there
would be no enlargement of the work by going into debt'': and in like
manner we cannot go on with that which already exists if we have not
sufficient means coming in to meet the current expenses." Thus the godly
man who loved to expand his service for God was humble enough to bow to
the will of God if its contraction seemed needful.

Prayer was much increased, and faith did not fail under the trial, which
continued for weeks and months, but was abundantly sustained by the
promises of an unfailing Helper. This distress was relieved in March by
the sale of ten acres of land, at one thousand pounds an acre, and at
the close of the year there was in hand a balance of over twenty-three
hundred pounds.

The exigency, however, continued more or less severe until again, in
1893-4, after several years of trial, the Lord once more bountifully
supplied means. And Mr. Müller is careful to add that though the
appearance during those years of trial was many times as if God had
forgotten or forsaken them and would never care any more about the
Institution, it was only in appearance, for he was as mindful of it as
ever, and he records how by this discipline faith was still further
strengthened, God was glorified in the patience and meekness whereby He
enabled them to endure the testing, and tens of thousands of believers
were blessed in afterward reading about these experience''s of divine
faithfulness.*

Five years after Mrs. Wright''s death, Mr. Müller was left again a
widower. His last great mission tour had come to an end in 1892, and in
1895, on the 13th of January, the beloved wife who in all these long
journeys had been his constant companion and helper, passed to her rest,
and once more left him peculiarly alone, since his devoted Lydia had
been called up higher. Yet by the same grace of God which had always
before sustained him he was now upheld, and not only kept in unbroken
peace, but enabled to "kiss the Hand which administered the stroke."

At the funeral of his second wife, as at that of the first, he made the
address, and the scene was unique in interest. Seldom does a man of
ninety conduct such a service. The faith that sustained him in every
other trial held him up in this. He lived in such habitual communion
with the unseen world, and walked in such uninterrupted fellowship with
the unseen God, that the exchange of worlds became too real for him to
mourn for those who had made it, or to murmur at the infinite Love that
numbers our days. It moved men more deeply than any spoken word of
witness to see him manifestly borne up as on everlasting Arms.

I remember Mr. Müller remarking that he waited eight years before he
understood at all the purpose of God in removing his first wife, who
seemed so indispensable to him and his work. His own journal explains
more fully this remark. When it pleased God to take from him his second
wife, after over twenty-three years of married life, again he rested on
the promise that "All things work together for good to them that love
God" and reflected on his past experiences of its truth. When he lost
his first wife after over thirty-nine years of happy wedlock, while he
bowed to the Father''s will, how that sorrow and bereavement could work
good had been wholly a matter of faith, for no compensating good was
apparent to sight; yet he believed God''s word and waited to see how it
would be fulfilled. That loss seemed one that could not be made up. Only
a little before, two orphan houses had been opened for nine hundred more
orphans, so that there were total accommodations for over two thousand;
she, who by nature, culture, gifts, and graces, was so wonderfully
fitted to be her husband''s helper, and who had with motherly love cared
for these children, was suddenly removed from his side. Four years after
Mr. Müller married his second wife, he saw it plainly to be God''s will
that he should spend life''s evening-time in giving witness to the
nations. These mission tours could not be otherwise than very trying to
the physical powers of endurance, since they covered over two hundred
thousand miles and obliged the travellers to spend a week at a time in a
train, and sometimes from four to six weeks on board a vessel. Mrs.
Müller, though never taking part in public, was severely taxed by all
this travel, and always busy, writing letters, circulating books and
tracts, and in various ways helping and relieving her husband. All at
once, while in the midst of these fatiguing journeys and exposures to
varying climates, it flashed upon Mr. Müller that his first wife, who
had died in her seventy-third year, could never have undertaken these
tours, and that the Lord had thus, in taking her, left him free to make
these extensive journeys. She would have been over fourscore years old
when these tours began, and, apart from age, could not have borne the
exhaustion, because of her frail health; whereas the second Mrs. Müller,
who, at the time, was not yet fifty-seven, was both by her age and
strength fully equal to the strain thus put upon her.

THE closing scene of this beautiful and eventful life-history has an
interest not altogether pathetic. Mr. Müller seems like an elevated
mountain, on whose summit the evening sun shines in lingering splendour,
and whose golden peak rises far above the ordinary level and belongs to
heaven more than earth, in the clear, cloudless calm of God.

From May, 1892, when the last mission tour closed; he devoted himself
mainly to the work of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, and to
preaching at Bethesda and elsewhere as God seemed to appoint. His health
was marvelous, especially considering how, when yet a young man,
frequent and serious illnesses and general debility had apparently
disqualified him from all military duty, and to many prophesied early
death or hopeless succumbing to disease. He had been in tropic heat and
arctic cold, in gales and typhoons at sea, and on journeys by rail,
sometimes as continuously long as a sea-voyage. He had borne the pest of
fleas, mosquitoes, and even rats. He had endured changes of climate,
diet, habits of life, and the strain of almost daily services, and come
out of all unscathed. This man, whose health was never robust, had gone
through labours that would try the mettle of an iron constitution; this
man, who had many times been laid aside by illness and sometimes for
months and who in 1837 had feared that a persistent head trouble might
unhinge his mind, could say, in his ninety-second year: "I have been
able, every day and all the day, to work, and that with ease, as seventy
years since." When the writer was holding meetings in Bristol in 1896,
on an anniversary very sacred to himself, he asked his beloved father
Müller to speak at the closing meeting of the series, in the Y.M.C.A.
Hall; and he did so, delivering a powerful address of forty-five
minutes, on Prayer in connection with Missions, and giving his own
life-story in part, with a vigour of voice and manner that seemed a
denial of his advanced age.*

The marvelous preservation of such a man at such an age reminds one of
Caleb, who at eighty-five could boast in God that he was as strong even
for war as in the day that he was sent into the land as one of the
spies; and Mr. Müller himself attributed this preservation to three
causes: first, the exercising of himself to have always a conscience
void of offence both toward God and toward men; secondly to the love he
felt for the Scriptures, and the constant recuperative power they
exercised upon his whole being; and third, to that happiness he felt in
God and His work, which relieved him of all anxiety and needless wear
and tear in his labours.

The great fundamental truth that this heroic man stamped on his
generation was that the Living God is the same to-day and forever as
yesterday and in all ages past, and that, with equal confidence with the
most trustful souls of any age, we may believe His word, and to every
promise add, like Abraham, our ''Amen''—IT SHALL BE SO!* When, a few
days after his death, Mr. E. H. Glenny, who is known to many as the
beloved and self-sacrificing friend of the North African Mission, passed
through Barcelona, he found written in an album over his signature the
words: "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and to-day and for ever." And,
like the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, quoting from the 102nd
Psalm, we may say of Jehovah, while all else changes and perishes:

Toward the close of life Mr. Müller, acting under medical advice, abated
somewhat of his active labours, preaching commonly but once a Sunday. It
was my privilege to hear him on the morning of the Lord''s day, March 22,
1896. He spoke on the 77th Psalm; of course he found here his favourite
theme—prayer; and, taking that as a fair specimen of his average
preaching, he was certainly a remarkable expositor of Scripture even at
ninety-one years of age. Later on the outline of this discourse will be
found.

On Sunday morning, March 6, 1898, he spoke at Alma Road Chapel, and on
the Monday evening following was at the prayer service at Bethesda, on
both occasions in his usual health. On Wednesday evening following, he
took his wonted place at the Orphan House prayer meeting and gave out
the hymns:

When he bade his beloved son-in-law "good-night," there was no outward
sign of declining strength. He seemed to the last the vigorous old man,
and retired to rest as usual. It had been felt that one so advanced in
years should have some night-attendant, especially as indications of
heart-weakness had been noticed of late, and he had yielded to the
pressure of love and consented to such an arrangement after that
night. But the consent came too late. He was never more to need human
attendance or attention. On Thursday morning, March 10th, at about seven
o''clock, the usual cup of tea was taken to his room. To the knock at the
door there was no response save an ominous silence. The attendant opened
the door, only to find that the venerable patriarch lay dead, on the
floor beside the bed. He had probably risen to take some nourishment—a
glass of milk and a biscuit being always put within reach—and, while
eating the biscuit, he had felt faint, and fallen, clutching at the
table-cloth as he fell, for it was dragged off, with certain things that
had lain on the table. His medical adviser, who was promptly summoned,
gave as his opinion that he had died of heart-failure some hour or two
before he had been found by his attendant.

Such a departure, even at such an age, produced a worldwide sensation.
That man''s moral and spiritual forces reached and touched the earth''s
ends. Not in Bristol, or in Britain alone, but across the mighty waters
toward the sunrise and sunset was felt the responsive pulse-beat of a
deep sympathy. Hearts bled all over the globe when it was announced, by
telegraph wire and ocean cable, that George Müller was dead. It was said
of a great Englishman that his influence could be measured only by
"parallels of latitude"; of George Müller we may add, and by meridians
of longitude. He belonged to the whole church and the whole world, in a
unique sense; and the whole race of man sustained a loss when he died.

The funeral, which took place on the Monday following, was a popular
tribute of affection, such as is seldom seen. Tens of thousands of
people reverently stood along the route of the simple procession; men
left their workshops and offices, women left their elegant homes or
humble kitchens, all seeking to pay a last token of respect. Bristol had
never before witnessed any such scene.

A brief service was held at Orphan House No. 3, where over a thousand
children met, who had for a second time lost a ''father''; in front of the
reading-desk in the great dining-room, a coffin of elm, studiously
plain, and by request without floral offerings, contained all that was
mortal of George Müller, and on a brass plate was a simple inscription,
giving the date of his death, and his age.

Mr. James Wright gave the address, reminding those who were gathered
that, to all of us, even those who have lived nearest God, death comes
while the Lord tarries; that it is blessed to die in the Lord; and that
for believers in Christ there is a glorious resurrection waiting. The
tears that ran down those young cheeks were more eloquent than any
words, as a token of affection for the dead. The procession silently
formed. Among those who followed the bier were four who had been
occupants of that first orphan home in Wilson Street. The children''s
grief melted the hearts of spectators, and eyes unused to weeping were
moistened that day. The various carriages bore the medical attendants,
the relatives and connections of Mr. Müller, the elders and deacons of
the churches with which he was associated, and his staff of helpers in
the work on Ashley Down. Then followed forty or fifty other vehicles
with deputations from various religious bodies, etc.

At Bethesda, every foot of space was crowded, and hundreds sought in
vain for admission. The hymn was sung which Mr. Müller had given out at
that last prayer meeting the night before his departure. Dr. Maclean of
Bath offered prayer, mingled with praise for such a long life of service
and witness, of prayer and faith, and Mr. Wright spoke from Hebrews
xiii. 7, 8:

"Remember them which have the rule over you,
    Who have spoken unto you the word of God:
    Whose faith follow,
    Considering the end of their conversation:
    Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and to-day and forever."

He spoke of those spiritual rulers and guides whom God sets over his
people; and of the privilege of imitating their faith, calling attention
to the two characteristics of his beloved father-in-law''s faith: first,
that it was based on that immovable Rock of Ages, God''s written word;
and secondly, that it translated the precepts and promises of that word
into daily life.

Mr. Wright made very emphatic Mr. Müller''s acceptance of the whole
Scriptures, as divinely inspired. He had been wont to say to young
believers, "Put your finger on the passage on which your faith rests,"
and had himself read the Bible from end to end nearly two hundred times.
He fed on the Word and therefore was strong. He found the centre of that
Word in the living Person it enshrines, and his one ground of confidence
was His atoning work. Always in his own eyes weak, wretched, and vile,
unworthy of the smallest blessing, he rested solely on the merit and
mediation of His great High Priest.

George Müller cultivated faith. He used to say to his helpers in
prayer and service, "Never let enter your minds a shadow of doubt as to
the love of the Father''s heart or the power of the Father''s arm." And he
projected his whole life forward, and looked at it in the light of the
Judgment Day.

Mr. Wright''s address made prominent one or two other most important
lessons, as, for example, that the Spirit bids us imitate, not the
idiosyncrasies or philanthropy of others, but their faith. And he took
occasion to remind his hearers that philanthropy was not the foremost
aim or leading feature of Mr. Müller''s life, but above all else to
magnify and glorify God, "as still the living God who, now as well as
thousands of years ago, hears the prayers of His children and helps
those who trust Him." He touchingly referred to the humility that led
Mr. Müller to do the mightiest thing for God without self-consciousness,
and showed that God can take up and use those who are willing to be only
instruments.

Mr. Wright further remarked: "I have been asked again and again lately
as to whether the orphan work would go on. It is going on. Since the
commencement of the year we have received between forty and fifty fresh
orphans, and this week expect to receive more. The other four objects of
the Institution, according to the ability God gives us, are still being
carried on. We believe that whatever God would do with regard to the
future will be worthy of Him. We do not know much more, and do not want
to. He knows what He will do. I cannot think, however, that the God who
has so blessed the work for so long will leave our prayers as to the
future unanswered."

Mr. Benjamin Perry then spoke briefly, characterizing Mr. Müller as the
greatest personality Bristol had known as a citizen. He referred to his
power as an expounder of Scripture, and to the fact that he brought to
others for their comfort and support what had first been food to his own
soul. He gave some personal reminiscences, referring, for instance, to
his ability at an extreme old age still to work without hindrance either
mental or physical, free from rheumatism, ache, or pain, and seldom
suffering from exhaustion. He briefly described him as one who, in
response to the infinite love of God, which called him from a life of
sin to a life of salvation and service, wholly loved God above everybody
and everything, so that his highest pleasure was to please and serve
Him. As an illustration of his humility, he gave an incident. When of
late a friend had said, "When God calls you home, it will be like a
ship going into harbour, full sail."—"Oh no!" said Mr. Müller, "it is
poor George Müller who needs daily to pray, ''Hold Thou me up in my
goings, that my footsteps slip not.''" The close of such lives as those
of Asa and Solomon were to Mr. Müller a perpetual warning, leading him
to pray that he might never thus depart from the Lord in his old age.

And after another prayer by Mr. Stanley Arnot, the body was borne to its
resting-place in Arno''s Vale Cemetery, and buried beside the bodies of
Mr. Müller''s first and second wives, some eighty carriages joining in the
procession to the grave. Everything from first to last was as simple and
unostentatious as he himself would have wished. At the graveside Col.
Molesworth prayed, and Mr. George F. Bergin read from 1 Cor. xv. and
spoke a few words upon the tenth verse, which so magnifies the grace of
God both in what we are and what we do.

Mr. E. K. Groves, nephew of Mr. Müller, announced as the closing hymn
the second given out by him at that last prayer meeting at the
orphanage.

Mr. E. T. Davies then offered prayer, and the body was left to its
undisturbed repose, until the Lord shall come.

Other memorial services were held at the Y.M.C.A. Hall, and very
naturally at Bethesda Chapel, which brought to a fitting close this
series of loving tributes to the departed. On the Lord''s day preceding
the burial, in nearly all the city pulpits, more or less extended
reference had been made to the life, the character, and the career of
the beloved saint who had for so many years lived his irreproachable
life in Bristol. Also the daily and weekly press teemed with obituary
notices, and tributes to his piety, worth, and work.

It was touchingly remarked at his funeral that he first confessed to
feeling weak and weary in his work that last night of his earthly
sojourn; and it seemed specially tender of the Lord not to allow that
sense of exhaustion to come upon him until just as He was about to send
His chariot to bear him to His presence. Mr. Müller''s last sermon at
Bethesda Chapel, after a ministry of sixty-six years, had been from 2
Cor. v. 1:

"For we know that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens."

It was as though he had some foretokens of his being about shortly to
put off this his tabernacle. Evidently he was not taken by surprise. He
had foreseen that his days were fast completing their number. Seven
months before his departure, he had remarked to his medical attendant,
in connection with the irregularity of his pulse: "It means death."

Many of the dear orphans—as when the first Mrs. Müller died—wrote,
asking that they might contribute toward the erection of a monument to
the memory of their beloved benefactor. Already one dear young servant
had gathered, for the purpose, over twenty pounds. In conformity with
the known wishes of his father-in-law that only the simplest headstone
be placed over his remains, Mr. Wright thought necessary to check the
inflow of such gifts, the sum in hand being quite sufficient.

Further urgent appeals were made both from British and American friends,
for the erection of some statue or other large visible monument or
memorial, and in these appeals the local newspapers united. At length
private letters led Mr. Wright to communicate with the public press, as
the best way at once to silence these appeals and express the ground of
rejecting such proposals. He wrote as follows:

"You ask me, as one long and closely associated with the late Mr. George
Müller, to say what I think would be most in accordance with his own
wishes as a fitting memorial of himself.

"1st. When he erected Orphan House No. 1, and the question came what is
the building to be called, he deliberately avoided associating his own
name with it, and named it ''The New Orphan House, Ashley Down.'' N.B.—To
the end of his life he disliked hearing or reading the words ''Müller''s
Orphanage.'' In keeping with this, for years, in every Annual Report,
when referring to the Orphanage he reiterated the statement, ''The New
Orphan Houses on Ashley Down, Bristol, are not my Orphan Houses,...
they are God''s Orphan Houses.'' (See, for example, the Report for 1897,
p. 69.)

"2nd. For years, in fact until he was nearly eighty years old, he
steadily refused to allow any portrait of himself to be published; and
only most reluctantly (for reasons which he gives with characteristic
minuteness in the preface to ''Preaching Tours'') did he at length give
way on this point.

"3rd. In the last published Report, at page 66, he states: ''The primary
object I had in view in carrying on this work,'' viz., ''that it might be
seen that now, in the nineteenth century, God is still the Living God,
and that now, as well as thousands of years ago, He listens to the
prayers of His children and helps those who trust in Him.'' From these
words and ways of acting, is it not evident, that the only ''memorial''
that George Müller cared about was that which consists in the effect of
his example, Godward, upon his fellow men? Every soul converted to God
(instrumentally) through his words or example constitutes a permanent
memorial to him as the father in Christ of such an one. Every believer
strengthened in faith (instrumentally) through his words or example
constitutes a similar memorial to his spiritual teacher.

"He knew that God had, already, in the riches of His grace, given him
many such memorials; and he departed this life, as I well know,
cherishing the most lively hope that he should greet above thousands
more to whom it had pleased God to make him a channel of rich spiritual
blessing.

"He used often to say to me, when he opened a letter in which the writer
poured out a tale of sore pecuniary need, and besought his help to an
extent twice or three or ten times exceeding the sum total of his (Mr.
Müller''s) earthly possessions at the moment, ''Ah! these dear people
entirely miss the lesson I am trying to teach them, for they come to
me, instead of going to God.'' And if he could come back to us for an
hour, and listen to an account of what his sincerely admiring, but
mistaken, friends are proposing to do to perpetuate his memory, I can
hear him, with a sigh, exclaiming, ''Ah! these dear friends are
entirely missing the lesson that I tried for seventy years to teach
them,'' viz., ''That a man can receive nothing except it be given him
from above,'' and that, therefore, it is the Blessed Giver, and not
the poor receiver, that is to be glorified.

DEATH shuts the door upon earthly service, whatever door it may open to
other forms and spheres of activity. There are many intimations that
service beyond the grave is both unceasing and untiring: the blessed
dead "rest indeed from their labours"—toilsome and painful
tasks—"but their works"—activities for God—"do follow them," where
exertion is without exhaustion.

This is therefore a fit point for summing up the results of the work
over which, from its beginning, one man had specially had charge. One
sentence from Mr. Müller''s pen marks the purpose which was the very
pivot of his whole being: "I have joyfully dedicated my whole life to
the object of exemplifying how much may be accomplished by prayer and
faith." This prepared both for the development of the character of him
who had such singleness of aim, and for the development of the work in
which that aim found action. Mr. Müller''s oldest friend, Robert C.
Chapman of Barnstaple, beautifully says that "when a man''s chief
business is to serve and please the Lord, all his circumstances become
his servants"; and we shall find this maxim true in Mr. Müller''s
life-work.

The Fifty-ninth Report, issued May 26, 1898, was the last up to the date
of the publication of this volume, and the first after Mr. Müller''s
death. In this, Mr. Wright gives the brief but valuable summary not only
of the whole work of the year preceding, but of the whole work from its
beginning, and thus helps us to a comprehensive survey.

This report is doubly precious as it contains also the last contribution
of Mr. Müller''s own pen to the record of the Lord''s dealings. It is
probable that on the afternoon of March 9th he laid down his pen, for
the last time, all unconscious that he was never again to take it up. He
had made, in a twofold sense, his closing entry in life''s solemn
journal! In the evening of that day he took his customary part in the
prayer service in the orphan house—then went to sleep for the last time
on earth; there came a waking hour, when he was alone with God, and
suddenly departed, leaving his body to its long sleep that knows no
waking until the day of the Lord''s coming, while his spirit returned
unto God who gave it.

The afternoon of that day of death, and of ''birth'' into the heavenly
life—as the catacomb saints called it—found the helpers again
assembled in the same prayer room to commit the work to him "who only
hath immortality," and who, amid all changes of human administration,
ever remains the divine Master Workman, never at a loss for His own
chosen instruments.

Mr. Wright, in this report, shows himself God''s chosen successor in the
work, evidently like-minded with the departed director. The first
paragraph, after the brief and touching reference to his father-in-law,
serves to convey to all friends of this work the assurance that he to
whom Mr. Müller left its conduct has also learned the one secret of all
success in coworking with God. It sounds, as the significant keynote
for the future, the same old keynote of the past, carrying on the melody
and harmony, without change, into the new measures. It is the same
oratorio, without alteration of theme, time, or even key: the leading
performer is indeed no more, but another hand takes up his instrument
and, trembling with emotion, continues the unfinished strain so that
there is no interruption. Mr. Wright says:

"It is written (Job xxvi. 7): ''He hangeth the earth upon
nothing''—that is, no visible support. And so we exult in the fact
that ''the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad'' hangs,
as it has ever hung, since its commencement, now more than sixty-four
years ago, ''upon nothing,'' that is, upon no VISIBLE support. It hangs
upon no human patron, upon no endowment or funded property, but solely
upon the good pleasure of the blessed God."

Blessed lesson to learn! that to hang upon the invisible God is not to
hang "upon nothing," though it be upon nothing visible. The power and
permanence of the invisible forces that hold up the earth after sixty
centuries of human history are sufficiently shown by the fact that this
great globe still swings securely in space and is whirled through its
vast orbit, and that, without variation of a second, it still moves with
divine exactness in its appointed path. We can therefore trust the same
invisible God to sustain with His unseen power all the work which faith
suspends upon His truth and love and unfailing word of promise, though
to the natural eye all these may seem as nothing.

Mr. Wright records also a very striking answer to long-continued prayer,
and a most impressive instance of the tender care of the Lord, in the
providing of an associate, every way like-minded, and well fitted to
share the responsibility falling upon his shoulders at the decease of
his father-in-law.

Feeling the burden too great for him, his one resource
was to cast his burden on the Lord. He and Mr. Müller had asked of God
such a companion in labour for three years before his departure, and Mr.
Wright and his dear wife had, for twenty-five years before that—from
the time when Mr. Müller''s long missionary tours began to withdraw him
from Bristol—besought of the Lord the same favour. But to none of them
had any name been suggested, or, if so, it had never been mentioned.

After that day of death, Mr. Wright felt that a gracious Father would
not long leave him to sustain this great burden alone, and about a
fortnight later he felt assured that it was the will of God that he
should ask Mr. George Frederic Bergin to join him in the work, who
seemed to him a "true yoke-fellow." He had known him well for a
quarter-century; he had worked by his side in the church; and though
they were diverse in temperament, there had never been a break in unity
or sympathy. Mr. Bergin was seventeen years his junior, and so likely to
survive and succeed him; he was very fond of children, and had been much
blessed in training his own in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
and hence was fitted to take charge of this larger family of orphans.
Confident of being led of God, he put the matter before Mr. Bergin,
delighted but not surprised to find that the same God had moved on his
mind also, and in the same direction; for not only was he ready to
respond to Mr. Wright''s appeal, but he had been led of God to feel that
he should, after a certain time, go to Mr. Wright and offer himself.
The Spirit who guided Philip to the Eunuch and at the same time had made
the Eunuch to inquire after guidance; who sent men from Cornelius and,
while they were knocking at Simon''s house, was bidding Peter go with
them, still moves in a mysterious way, and simultaneously, on those whom
He would bring together for cooperation in loving service. And thus Mr.
Wright found the Living God the same Helper and Supplier of every need,
after his beloved father-in-law had gone up higher; and felt constrained
to feel that the God of Elijah was still at the crossing of the Jordan
and could work the same wonders as before, supplying the need of the
hour when the need came.

Mr. Müller''s own gifts to the service of the Lord find in this
posthumous report their first full record and recognition. Readers of
the Annual Reports must have noticed an entry, recurring with strange
frequency during all these thirty or forty years, and therefore
suggesting a giver that must have reached a very ripe age: "from a
servant of the Lord Jesus, who, constrained by the love of Christ, seeks
to lay up treasure in heaven." If that entry be carefully followed
throughout and there be added the personal gifts made by Mr. Müller to
various benevolent objects, it will be found that the aggregate sum from
this "servant" reaches, up to March 1, 1898, a total of eighty-one
thousand four hundred and ninety pounds eighteen shillings and
eightpence. Mr. Wright, now that this "servant of the Lord Jesus" is
with his Master, who promised, "Where I am there shall also My servant
be," feels free to make known that this donor was no other than George
Müller himself who thus gave out of his own money—money given to him
for his own use or left to him by legacies—the total sum of about
sixty-four thousand five hundred pounds to the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution, and, in other directions, seventeen thousand more.

This is a record of personal gifts to which we know no parallel. It
reminds us of the career of John Wesley, whose simplicity and frugality
of habits enabled him not only to limit his own expenditure to a very
small sum, but whose Christian liberality and unselfishness prompted him
to give all that he could thus save to purely benevolent
objects. While he had but thirty pounds a year, he lived on twenty-eight
and gave away forty shillings. Receiving twice as much the next year, he
still kept his living expenses down to the twenty-eight pounds and had
thirty-two to bestow on the needy; and when the third year his income
rose to ninety pounds, he spent no more than before and gave away
sixty-two. The fourth year brought one hundred and twenty, and he
disbursed still but the same sum for his own needs, having ninety-two to
spare. It is calculated that in the course of his life he thus gave away
at least thirty thousand pounds, and four silver spoons comprised all
the silver plate that he possessed when the collectors of taxes called
upon him. Such economy on the one hand and such generosity on the other
have seldom been known in human history. But George Müller''s record will
compare favourably with this or any other of modern days. His frugality,
simplicity, and economy were equal to Wesley''s, and his gifts aggregated
eighty-one thousand pounds. Mr. Müller had received increasingly large
sums from the Lord which he invested well and most profitably, so that
for over sixty years he never lost a penny through a bad speculation!
But his investments were not in lands or banks or railways, but in the
work of God. He made friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness that
when he failed received him into everlasting habitations. He continued,
year after year, to make provision for himself, his beloved wife and
daughter, by laying up treasure—in heaven. Such a man had certainly a
right to exhort others to systematic beneficence. He gave—as not one in
a million gives—not a tithe, not any fixed proportion of annual income,
but all that was left after the simplest and most necessary supply of
actual wants. While most Christians regard themselves as doing their
duty if, after they have given a portion to the Lord, they spend all the
rest on themselves, God led George Müller to reverse this rule and
reserve only the most frugal sum for personal needs, that the entire
remainder might be given to him that needeth. The utter revolution
implied in our habits of giving which would be necessary were such a
rule adopted is but too obvious. Mr. Müller''s own words are:

He kept continually before him his stewardship of God''s property; and
sought to make the most of the one brief life on earth, and to use for
the best and largest good the property held by him in trust. The things
of God were deep realities, and, projecting every action and decision
and motive into the light of the judgment-seat of Christ, he asked
himself how it would appear to him in the light of that tribunal. Thus
he sought prayerfully and conscientiously so to live and labour, so to
deny himself, and, by love, serve God and man, as that he should not be
ashamed before Him at His coming. But not in a spirit of fear was this
done; for if any man of his generation knew the perfect love that casts
out fear, it was George Müller. He felt that God is love, and love is of
God. He saw that love manifested in the greatest of gifts—His
only-begotten Son at Calvary—he knew and believed the Love that God
hath to us; he received it into his own heart; it became an abiding
presence, manifested in obedience and benevolence, and, subduing him
more and more, it became perfected so as to expel tormenting fear and
impart a holy confidence and delight in God.

"Give and it shall be given unto you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken
together and running over shall men give into your bosom."

He believed this promise and he verified it. His testimony is: "I had
GIVEN, and God had caused to be GIVEN TO ME AGAIN, and bountifully."

He says that he BELIEVED what he found in the word of God, and by His
grace sought to ACT ACCORDINGLY, and thus again records that he was
blessed abundantly and his peace and joy in the Holy Ghost increased
more and more.

It will not be a surprise, therefore, that, as has been already noted,
Mr. Müller''s entire personal estate at his death, as sworn to, when
the will was admitted to probate, was only 169 pounds 9s. 4d., of which
books, household furniture, etc., were reckoned at over one hundred
pounds, the only money in his possession being a trifle over sixty
pounds, and even this only awaiting disbursement as God''s steward.

The will of Mr. Müller contains a pregnant clause which should not be
forgotten in this memorial. It closes with a paragraph which is deeply
significant as meant to be his posthumous word of testimony—"a last
testament":

"I cannot help admiring God''s wondrous grace in bringing me to the
knowledge of the Lord Jesus when I was an entirely careless and
thoughtless young man, and that He has kept me in His fear and truth,
allowing me the great honour, for so long a time, of serving Him."

In the comprehensive summary contained in this Fifty-ninth Report,
remarkable growth is apparent during the sixty-four years since the
outset of the work in 1834. During the year ending May 26, 1898, the
number of day-schools was 7, and of pupils, 354; the number of children
in attendance from the beginning, 81,501. The number of home
Sunday-schools, 12, and of children in them, 1341; but from the
beginning, 32,944. The number of Sunday-schools aided in England and
Wales, 25. The amount expended in connection with home schools, 736
pounds 13s. 10d.; from the outset, 109,992 pounds 19s. 10d. The Bibles
and parts thereof circulated, 15,411; from the beginning, 1,989,266.
Money expended for this purpose the past year, 439 pounds; from the
first, 41,090 pounds 13s. 3d. Missionary labourers aided, 115. Money
expended, 2082 pounds 9s. 6d; from the outset, 261,859 pounds 7s. 4d.
Circulation of books and tracts, 3,101,338. Money spent, 1001 pounds
3s.; and from the first, 47,188 pounds 11s. 10d. The number of orphans
on Ashley Down, 1620; and from the first, 10,024. Money spent in orphan
houses, last year, 22,523 pounds 13s. 1d.; and from the beginning,
988,829 pounds.

To carry out conviction into action is sometimes a costly sacrifice; but
whatever Mr. Müller''s fidelity to conviction cost in one way, he had
stupendous results of his life-work to contemplate, even while he lived.
Let any one look at the above figures and facts, and remember that here
was one poor man who, dependent on the help of God only in answer to
prayer, could look back over threescore years and see how he had built
five large orphan houses and taken into his family over ten thousand
orphans, expending, for their good, within twelve thousand pounds of a
round million. He had given aid to day-schools and Sunday-schools, in
this and other lands, where nearly one hundred and fifty thousand
children have been taught, at a cost of over one hundred and ten
thousand pounds more. He had circulated nearly two million Bibles and
parts thereof at the cost of over forty thousand pounds; and over three
million books and tracts, at a cost of nearly fifty thousand pounds
more. And besides all this he had spent over two hundred and sixty
thousand pounds to aid missionary labourers in various lands. The sum
total of the money thus spent during sixty years has thus reached very
nearly the astonishing aggregate of one and a half million of pounds
sterling ($7,500,000).

To summarize Mr. Müller''s service we must understand his great secret.
Such a life and such a work are the result of one habit more than all
else,—daily and frequent communion with God. Unwearied in supplications
and intercessions, we have seen how, in every new need and crisis,
prayer was the one resort, the prayer of faith. He first satisfied
himself that he was in the way of duty; then he fixed his mind upon the
unchanging word of promise; then, in the boldness of a suppliant who
comes to a throne of grace in the name of Jesus Christ and pleads the
assurance of t

-- Update content for 'The Arabian Nights (Selected Tales)'
UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'The stories in the Fairy Books have generally been such as old women in
country places tell to their grandchildren.  Nobody knows how old they
are, or who told them first.  The children of Ham, Shem and Japhet may
have listened to them in the Ark, on wet days.  Hector''s little boy may
have heard them in Troy Town, for it is certain that Homer knew them,
and that some of them were written down in Egypt about the time of
Moses.

People in different countries tell them differently, but they are
always the same stories, really, whether among little Zulus, at the
Cape, or little Eskimo, near the North Pole.  The changes are only in
matters of manners and customs; such as wearing clothes or not, meeting
lions who talk in the warm countries, or talking bears in the cold
countries.  There are plenty of kings and queens in the fairy tales,
just because long ago there were plenty of kings in the country.  A
gentleman who would be a squire now was a kind of king in Scotland in
very old times, and the same in other places.  These old stories, never
forgotten, were taken down in writing in different ages, but mostly in
this century, in all sorts of languages.  These ancient stories are the
contents of the Fairy books.

Now "The Arabian Nights," some of which, but not nearly all, are given
in this volume, are only fairy tales of the East.  The people of Asia,
Arabia, and Persia told them in their own way, not for children, but
for grown-up people.  There were no novels then, nor any printed books,
of course; but there were people whose profession it was to amuse men
and women by telling tales.  They dressed the fairy stories up, and
made the characters good Mahommedans, living in Bagdad or India.  The
events were often supposed to happen in the reign of the great Caliph,
or ruler of the Faithful, Haroun al Raschid, who lived in Bagdad in
786-808 A.D. The vizir who accompanies the Caliph was also a real
person of the great family of the Barmecides.  He was put to death by
the Caliph in a very cruel way, nobody ever knew why.  The stories must
have been told in their present shape a good long while after the
Caliph died, when nobody knew very exactly what had really happened.
At last some storyteller thought of writing down the tales, and fixing
them into a kind of framework, as if they had all been narrated to a
cruel Sultan by his wife.  Probably the tales were written down about
the time when Edward I. was fighting Robert Bruce.  But changes were
made in them at different times, and a great deal that is very dull and
stupid was put in, and plenty of verses.  Neither the verses nor the
dull pieces are given in this book.

People in France and England knew almost nothing about "The Arabian
Nights" till the reigns of Queen Anne and George I., when they were
translated into French by Monsieur Galland.  Grown-up people were then
very fond of fairy tales, and they thought these Arab stories the best
that they had ever read.  They were delighted with Ghouls (who lived
among the tombs) and Geni, who seemed to be a kind of ogres, and with
Princesses who work magic spells, and with Peris, who are Arab fairies.
Sindbad had adventures which perhaps came out of the Odyssey of Homer;
in fact, all the East had contributed its wonders, and sent them to
Europe in one parcel.  Young men once made a noise at Monsieur
Galland''s windows in the dead of night, and asked him to tell them one
of his marvellous tales.  Nobody talked of anything but dervishes and
vizirs, rocs and peris.  The stories were translated from French into
all languages, and only Bishop Atterbury complained that the tales were
not likely to be true, and had no moral.  The bishop was presently
banished for being on the side of Prince Charlie''s father, and had
leisure to repent of being so solemn.

In this book "The Arabian Nights" are translated from the French
version of Monsieur Galland, who dropped out the poetry and a great
deal of what the Arabian authors thought funny, though it seems
wearisome to us.  In this book the stories are shortened here and
there, and omissions are made of pieces only suitable for Arabs and old
gentlemen.  The translations are by the writers of the tales in the
Fairy Books, and the pictures are by Mr. Ford.

I can remember reading "The Arabian Nights" when I was six years old,
in dirty yellow old volumes of small type with no pictures, and I hope
children who read them with Mr. Ford''s pictures will be as happy as I
was then in the company of Aladdin and Sindbad the Sailor.

In the chronicles of the ancient dynasty of the Sassanidae, who reigned
for about four hundred years, from Persia to the borders of China,
beyond the great river Ganges itself, we read the praises of one of the
kings of this race, who was said to be the best monarch of his time.
His subjects loved him, and his neighbors feared him, and when he died
he left his kingdom in a more prosperous and powerful condition than
any king had done before him.

The two sons who survived him loved each other tenderly, and it was a
real grief to the elder, Schahriar, that the laws of the empire forbade
him to share his dominions with his brother Schahzeman.  Indeed, after
ten years, during which this state of things had not ceased to trouble
him, Schahriar cut off the country of Great Tartary from the Persian
Empire and made his brother king.

Now the Sultan Schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the
world, and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour,
and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful jewels.  It
was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he accidentally
discovered, after several years, that she had deceived him completely,
and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad, that he felt
himself obliged to carry out the law of the land, and order the
grand-vizir to put her to death.  The blow was so heavy that his mind
almost gave way, and he declared that he was quite sure that at bottom
all women were as wicked as the sultana, if you could only find them
out, and that the fewer the world contained the better.  So every
evening he married a fresh wife and had her strangled the following
morning before the grand-vizir, whose duty it was to provide these
unhappy brides for the Sultan.  The poor man fulfilled his task with
reluctance, but there was no escape, and every day saw a girl married
and a wife dead.

This behaviour caused the greatest horror in the town, where nothing
was heard but cries and lamentations.  In one house was a father
weeping for the loss of his daughter, in another perhaps a mother
trembling for the fate of her child; and instead of the blessings that
had formerly been heaped on the Sultan''s head, the air was now full of
curses.

The grand-vizir himself was the father of two daughters, of whom the
elder was called Scheherazade, and the younger Dinarzade.  Dinarzade
had no particular gifts to distinguish her from other girls, but her
sister was clever and courageous in the highest degree.  Her father had
given her the best masters in philosophy, medicine, history and the
fine arts, and besides all this, her beauty excelled that of any girl
in the kingdom of Persia.

One day, when the grand-vizir was talking to his eldest daughter, who
was his delight and pride, Scheherazade said to him, "Father, I have a
favour to ask of you.  Will you grant it to me?"

"Then listen," said Scheherazade.  "I am determined to stop this
barbarous practice of the Sultan''s, and to deliver the girls and
mothers from the awful fate that hangs over them."

"It would be an excellent thing to do," returned the grand-vizir, "but
how do you propose to accomplish it?"

"My father," answered Scheherazade, "it is you who have to provide the
Sultan daily with a fresh wife, and I implore you, by all the affection
you bear me, to allow the honour to fall upon me."

"Have you lost your senses?" cried the grand-vizir, starting back in
horror.  "What has put such a thing into your head?  You ought to know
by this time what it means to be the sultan''s bride!"

"Yes, my father, I know it well," replied she, "and I am not afraid to
think of it.  If I fail, my death will be a glorious one, and if I
succeed I shall have done a great service to my country."

"It is of no use," said the grand-vizir, "I shall never consent.  If
the Sultan was to order me to plunge a dagger in your heart, I should
have to obey.  What a task for a father!  Ah, if you do not fear death,
fear at any rate the anguish you would cause me."

"What, are you still so obstinate?" exclaimed the grand-vizir. "Why are
you so resolved upon your own ruin?"

But the maiden absolutely refused to attend to her father''s words, and
at length, in despair, the grand-vizir was obliged to give way, and
went sadly to the palace to tell the Sultan that the following evening
he would bring him Scheherazade.

"Sire," answered the grand-vizir, "it is her own wish.  Even the sad
fate that awaits her could not hold her back."

"Let there be no mistake, vizir," said the Sultan.  "Remember you will
have to take her life yourself.  If you refuse, I swear that your head
shall pay forfeit."

"Sire," returned the vizir.  "Whatever the cost, I will obey you.
Though a father, I am also your subject."  So the Sultan told the
grand-vizir he might bring his daughter as soon as he liked.

The vizir took back this news to Scheherazade, who received it as if it
had been the most pleasant thing in the world.  She thanked her father
warmly for yielding to her wishes, and, seeing him still bowed down
with grief, told him that she hoped he would never repent having
allowed her to marry the Sultan.  Then she went to prepare herself for
the marriage, and begged that her sister Dinarzade should be sent for
to speak to her.

"My dear sister; I want your help in a very important affair.  My
father is going to take me to the palace to celebrate my marriage with
the Sultan.  When his Highness receives me, I shall beg him, as a last
favour, to let you sleep in our chamber, so that I may have your
company during the last night I am alive.  If, as I hope, he grants me
my wish, be sure that you wake me an hour before the dawn, and speak to
me in these words:  ''My sister, if you are not asleep, I beg you,
before the sun rises, to tell me one of your charming stories.''  Then I
shall begin, and I hope by this means to deliver the people from the
terror that reigns over them." Dinarzade replied that she would do with
pleasure what her sister wished.

When the usual hour arrived the grand-vizir conducted Scheherazade to
the palace, and left her alone with the Sultan, who bade her raise her
veil and was amazed at her beauty.  But seeing her eyes full of tears,
he asked what was the matter.  "Sire," replied Scheherazade, "I have a
sister who loves me as tenderly as I love her.  Grant me the favour of
allowing her to sleep this night in the same room, as it is the last we
shall be together."  Schahriar consented to Scheherazade''s petition and
Dinarzade was sent for.

An hour before daybreak Dinarzade awoke, and exclaimed, as she had
promised, "My dear sister, if you are not asleep, tell me I pray you,
before the sun rises, one of your charming stories.  It is the last
time that I shall have the pleasure of hearing you."

Scheherazade did not answer her sister, but turned to the Sultan.
"Will your highness permit me to do as my sister asks?" said she.

Sire, there was once upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth,
in land and merchandise, as well as in ready money.  He was obliged
from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs.  One day,
having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse, taking with
him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits and dates,
because he had to pass through the desert where no food was to be got.
He arrived without any mishap, and, having finished his business, set
out on his return.  On the fourth day of his journey, the heat of the
sun being very great, he turned out of his road to rest under some
trees.  He found at the foot of a large walnut-tree a fountain of clear
and running water.  He dismounted, fastened his horse to a branch of
the tree, and sat by the fountain, after having taken from his wallet
some of his dates and biscuits.  When he had finished this frugal meal
he washed his face and hands in the fountain.

When he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius, white with rage,
coming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand.

As he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell.  The merchant,
quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster as at his
words, answered him tremblingly, "Alas, good sir, what can I have done
to you to deserve death?"

"But," said the merchant, "how can I have killed your son?  I do not
know him, and I have never even seen him."

"When you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground?" asked the
genius, "and did you not take some dates from your wallet, and whilst
eating them did not you throw the stones about?"

"Then," said the genius, "I tell you you have killed my son, for whilst
you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by, and one of them
struck him in the eye and killed him.  So I shall kill you."

"No," said the genius, "I shall kill you as you killed my son," and so
saying, he seized the merchant by the arm, threw him on the ground, and
lifted his sabre to cut off his head.

The merchant, protesting his innocence, bewailed his wife and children,
and tried pitifully to avert his fate.  The genius, with his raised
scimitar, waited till he had finished, but was not in the least touched.

Scheherazade, at this point, seeing that it was day, and knowing that
the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council, stopped
speaking.

"The rest is still more wonderful," replied Scheherazade, "and you
would say so, if the sultan would allow me to live another day, and
would give me leave to tell it to you the next night."

Schahriar, who had been listening to Scheherazade with pleasure, said
to himself, "I will wait till to-morrow; I can always have her killed
when I have heard the end of her story."

All this time the grand-vizir was in a terrible state of anxiety.  But
he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan enter the council-chamber
without giving the terrible command that he was expecting.

The next morning, before the day broke, Dinarzade said to her sister,
"Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to go on with your story."

The Sultan did not wait for Scheherazade to ask his leave.  "Finish,"
said he, "the story of the genius and the merchant.  I am curious to
hear the end."

So Scheherazade went on with the story.  This happened every morning.
The Sultana told a story, and the Sultan let her live to finish it.

When the merchant saw that the genius was determined to cut off his
head, he said:  "One word more, I entreat you.  Grant me a little
delay; just a short time to go home and bid my wife and children
farewell, and to make my will.  When I have done this I will come back
here, and you shall kill me."

"But," said the genius, "if I grant you the delay you ask, I am afraid
that you will not come back."

"I ask you for a year''s grace," replied the merchant.  "I promise you
that to-morrow twelvemonth, I shall be waiting under these trees to
give myself up to you."

When he arrived home his wife and children received him with the
greatest joy.  But instead of embracing them he began to weep so
bitterly that they soon guessed that something terrible was the matter.

Then he told them what had passed between him and the genius, and how
he had given his word to return at the end of a year to be killed.
When they heard this sad news they were in despair, and wept much.

The next day the merchant began to settle his affairs, and first of all
to pay his debts.  He gave presents to his friends, and large alms to
the poor.  He set his slaves at liberty, and provided for his wife and
children.  The year soon passed away, and he was obliged to depart.
When he tried to say good-bye he was quite overcome with grief, and
with difficulty tore himself away.  At length he reached the place
where he had first seen the genius, on the very day that he had
appointed.  He dismounted, and sat down at the edge of the fountain,
where he awaited the genius in terrible suspense.

Whilst he was thus waiting an old man leading a hind came towards him.
They greeted one another, and then the old man said to him, "May I ask,
brother, what brought you to this desert place, where there are so many
evil genii about?  To see these beautiful trees one would imagine it
was inhabited, but it is a dangerous place to stop long in."

"This is a most marvellous affair.  I should like to be a witness of
your interview with the genius."  So saying he sat down by the merchant.

While they were talking another old man came up, followed by two black
dogs.  He greeted them, and asked what they were doing in this place.
The old man who was leading the hind told him the adventure of the
merchant and the genius.  The second old man had not sooner heard the
story than he, too, decided to stay there to see what would happen.  He
sat down by the others, and was talking, when a third old man arrived.
He asked why the merchant who was with them looked so sad.  They told
him the story, and he also resolved to see what would pass between the
genius and the merchant, so waited with the rest.

They soon saw in the distance a thick smoke, like a cloud of dust.
This smoke came nearer and nearer, and then, all at once, it vanished,
and they saw the genius, who, without speaking to them, approached the
merchant, sword in hand, and, taking him by the arm, said, "Get up and
let me kill you as you killed my son."

Then the old man leading the hind threw himself at the monster''s feet
and said, "O Prince of the Genii, I beg of you to stay your fury and to
listen to me.  I am going to tell you my story and that of the hind I
have with me, and if you find it more marvellous than that of the
merchant whom you are about to kill, I hope that you will do away with
a third part of his punishment?"

This hind that you see with me is my wife.  We have no children of our
own, therefore I adopted the son of a favorite slave, and determined to
make him my heir.

My wife, however, took a great dislike to both mother and child, which
she concealed from me till too late.  When my adopted son was about ten
years old I was obliged to go on a journey.  Before I went I entrusted
to my wife''s keeping both the mother and child, and begged her to take
care of them during my absence, which lasted a whole year.  During this
time she studied magic in order to carry out her wicked scheme.  When
she had learnt enough she took my son into a distant place and changed
him into a calf.  Then she gave him to my steward, and told him to look
after a calf she had bought.  She also changed the slave into a cow,
which she sent to my steward.

When I returned I inquired after my slave and the child.  "Your slave
is dead," she said, "and as for your son, I have not seen him for two
months, and I do not know where he is."

I was grieved to hear of my slave''s death, but as my son had only
disappeared, I thought I should soon find him.  Eight months, however,
passed, and still no tidings of him; then the feast of Bairam came.

To celebrate it I ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow to
sacrifice.  He did so.  The cow that he brought was my unfortunate
slave.  I bound her, but just as I was about to kill her she began to
low most piteously, and I saw that her eyes were streaming with tears.
It seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a movement of pity, I
ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another.  My wife, who
was present, scoffed at my compassion, which made her malice of no
avail.  "What are you doing?" she cried.  "Kill this cow.  It is the
best we have to sacrifice."

The steward killed her, but on skinning her found that she was nothing
but bones, although she appeared so fat.  I was vexed.

"Keep her for yourself," I said to the steward, "and if you have a fat
calf, bring that in her stead."

In a short time he brought a very fat calf, which, although I did not
know it, was my son.  It tried hard to break its cord and come to me.
It threw itself at my feet, with its head on the ground, as if it
wished to excite my pity, and to beg me not to take away its life.

"Go," I said to the steward, "take back this calf, take great care of
it, and bring me another in its place instantly."

As soon as my wife heard me speak this she at once cried out, "What are
you doing, husband?  Do not sacrifice any calf but this."

"Wife," I answered, "I will not sacrifice this calf," and in spite of
all her remonstrances, I remained firm.

I had another calf killed; this one was led away.  The next day the
steward asked to speak to me in private.

"I have come," he said, "to tell you some news which I think you will
like to hear.  I have a daughter who knows magic.  Yesterday, when I
was leading back the calf which you refused to sacrifice, I noticed
that she smiled, and then directly afterwards began to cry.  I asked
her why she did so."

"Father," she answered, "this calf is the son of our master.  I smile
with joy at seeing him still alive, and I weep to think of his mother,
who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow.  These changes have been wrought
by our master''s wife, who hated the mother and son."

"At these words, of Genius," continued the old man, "I leave you to
imagine my astonishment.  I went immediately with the steward to speak
with his daughter myself.  First of all I went to the stable to see my
son, and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses.  When the
steward''s daughter came I asked her if she could change my son back to
his proper shape."

"Yes, I can," she replied, "on two conditions.  One is that you will
give him to me for a husband, and the other is that you will let me
punish the woman who changed him into a calf."

"To the first condition," I answered, "I agree with all my heart, and I
will give you an ample dowry.  To the second I also agree, I only beg
you to spare her life."

Then she took a vessel of water and pronounced over it some words I did
not understand; then, on throwing the water over him, he became
immediately a young man once more.

"My son, my dear son," I exclaimed, kissing him in a transport of joy.
"This kind maiden has rescued you from a terrible enchantment, and I am
sure that out of gratitude you will marry her."

He consented joyfully, but before they were married, the young girl
changed my wife into a hind, and it is she whom you see before you.  I
wished her to have this form rather than a stranger one, so that we
could see her in the family without repugnance.

Since then my son has become a widower and has gone travelling.  I am
now going in search of him, and not wishing to confide my wife to the
care of other people, I am taking her with me.  Is this not a most
marvellous tale?

"It is indeed," said the genius, "and because of it I grant to you the
third part of the punishment of this merchant."

When the first old man had finished his story, the second, who was
leading the two black dogs, said to the genius, "I am going to tell you
what happened to me, and I am sure that you will find my story even
more astonishing than the one to which you have just been listening.
But when I have related it, will you grant me also the third part of
the merchant''s punishment?"

Great prince of the genii, you must know that we are three
brothers--these two black dogs and myself.  Our father died, leaving us
each a thousand sequins.  With this sum we all three took up the same
profession, and became merchants.  A short time after we had opened our
shops, my eldest brother, one of these two dogs, resolved to travel in
foreign countries for the sake of merchandise.  With this intention he
sold all he had and bought merchandise suitable to the voyages he was
about to make.  He set out, and was away a whole year.  At the end of
this time a beggar came to my shop.  "Good-day," I said.  "Good-day,"
he answered; "is it possible that you do not recognise me?"  Then I
looked at him closely and saw he was my brother.  I made him come into
my house, and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise.

"Do not question me," he replied, "see me, you see all I have.  It
would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that have
befallen me in a year, and have brought me to this state."

I shut up my shop, paid him every attention, taking him to the bath,
giving him my most beautiful robes.  I examined my accounts, and found
that I had doubled my capital--that is, that I now possessed two
thousand sequins.  I gave my brother half, saying:  "Now, brother, you
can forget your losses."  He accepted them with joy, and we lived
together as we had before.

Some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his business
and travel.  My eldest brother and I did all we could to dissuade him,
but it was of no use.  He joined a caravan and set out.  He came back
at the end of a year in the same state as his elder brother.  I took
care of him, and as I had a thousand sequins to spare I gave them to
him, and he re-opened his shop.

One day, my two brothers came to me to propose that we should make a
journey and trade.  At first I refused to go.  "You travelled," I said,
"and what did you gain?"  But they came to me repeatedly, and after
having held out for five years I at last gave way.  But when they had
made their preparation, and they began to buy the merchandise we
needed, they found they had spent every piece of the thousand sequins I
had given them.  I did not reproach them.  I divided my six thousand
sequins with them, giving a thousand to each and keeping one for
myself, and the other three I buried in a corner of my house.  We
bought merchandise, loaded a vessel with it, and set forth with a
favorable wind.

After two months'' sailing we arrived at a seaport, where we disembarked
and did a great trade.  Then we bought the merchandise of the country,
and were just going to sail once more, when I was stopped on the shore
by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman.  She came up to me, kissed
my hand, and implored me to marry her, and take her on board.  At first
I refused, but she begged so hard and promised to be such a good wife
to me, that at last I consented.  I got her some beautiful dresses, and
after having married her, we embarked and set sail.  During the voyage,
I discovered so many good qualities in my wife that I began to love her
more and more.  But my brothers began to be jealous of my prosperity,
and set to work to plot against my life.  One night when we were
sleeping they threw my wife and myself into the sea.  My wife, however,
was a fairy, and so she did not let me drown, but transported me to an
island.  When the day dawned, she said to me,

"When I saw you on the sea-shore I took a great fancy to you, and
wished to try your good nature, so I presented myself in the disguise
you saw.  Now I have rewarded you by saving your life.  But I am very
angry with your brothers, and I shall not rest till I have taken their
lives."

I appeased her wrath, and in a moment she transported me from the
island where we were to the roof of my house, and she disappeared a
moment afterwards.  I went down, and opened the doors, and dug up the
three thousand sequins which I had buried.  I went to the place where
my shop was, opened it, and received from my fellow-merchants
congratulations on my return.  When I went home, I saw two black dogs
who came to meet me with sorrowful faces.  I was much astonished, but
the fairy who reappeared said to me,

"Do not be surprised to see these dogs; they are your two brothers.  I
have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes." Then
having told me where I could hear news of her, she vanished.

The ten years are nearly passed, and I am on the road to find her.  As
in passing I met this merchant and the old man with the hind, I stayed
with them.

"Yes, indeed," replied the genius, "and I will give up to you the third
of the merchant''s punishment."

Then the third old man made the genius the same request as the other
two had done, and the genius promised him the last third of the
merchant''s punishment if his story surpassed both the others.

But I do know that it was even more marvellous than either of the
others, so that the genius was astonished, and said to the third old
man, "I will give up to you the third part of the merchant''s
punishment.  He ought to thank all three of you for having interested
yourselves in his favour.  But for you, he would be here no longer."

So saying, he disappeared, to the great joy of the company.  The
merchant did not fail to thank his friends, and then each went on his
way.  The merchant returned to his wife and children, and passed the
rest of his days happily with them.

"But, sire," added Scheherazade, "however beautiful are the stories I
have just told you, they cannot compare with the story of the
Fisherman."

Sire, there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he
could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children.  He went
every day to fish very early, and each day he made a rule not to throw
his nets more than four times.  He started out one morning by moonlight
and came to the sea-shore. He undressed and threw his nets, and as he
was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight.  He though he
had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased.  But a moment
afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the
carcase of an ass, he was much disappointed.

Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets, which
the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threw them a
second time.  In drawing them in he again felt a great weight, so that
he thought they were full of fish.  But he only found a large basket
full of rubbish.  He was much annoyed.

"O Fortune," he cried, "do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman,
who can hardly support his family!"

So saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed his nets
clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time.  But he only drew
in stones, shells, and mud.  He was almost in despair.

Then he threw his nets for the fourth time.  When he thought he had a
fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble.  There was no fish
however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight seemed full of
something, and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed with lead,
with the impression of a seal.  He was delighted.  "I will sell it to
the founder," he said; "with the money I shall get for it I shall buy a
measure of wheat."

He examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would
rattle.  But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression of
the seal and the lid, he thought there must be something precious
inside.  To find out, he took his knife, and with a little trouble he
opened it.  He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which
surprised him very much.  He set it in front of him, and whilst he was
looking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that he had to
step back a pace or two.  This smoke rose up to the clouds, and
stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a thick mist, which
caused the fisherman much astonishment.  When all the smoke was out of
the jar it gathered itself together, and became a thick mass in which
appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant.  When he saw
such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman would like to have run
away, but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step.

"What is this you are saying, great genius?  Tell me your history and
how you came to be shut up in that vase."

At this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily.  "Speak to me
more civilly," he said, "before I kill you."

"Alas! why should you kill me?" cried the fisherman.  "I have just
freed you; have you already forgotten that?"

"No," answered the genius; "but that will not prevent me from killing
you; and I am only going to grant you one favour, and that is to choose
the manner of your death."

"I cannot treat you in any other way," said the genius, "and if you
would know why, listen to my story.

"I rebelled against the king of the genii.  To punish me, he shut me up
in this vase of copper, and he put on the leaden cover his seal, which
is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out.  Then he had the vase
thrown into the sea.  During the first period of my captivity I vowed
that if anyone should free me before a hundred years were passed, I
would make him rich even after his death.  But that century passed, and
no one freed me.  In the second century I vowed that I would give all
the treasures in the world to my deliverer; but he never came.

"In the third, I promised to make him a king, to be always near him,
and to grant him three wishes every day; but that century passed away
as the other two had done, and I remained in the same plight.  At last
I grew angry at being captive for so long, and I vowed that if anyone
would release me I would kill him at once, and would only allow him to
choose in what manner he should die.  So you see, as you have freed me
to-day, choose in what way you will die."

The fisherman was very unhappy.  "What an unlucky man I am to have
freed you!  I implore you to spare my life."

"Since I must die," he said, "before I choose the manner of my death, I
conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were in that vase?"

"I really cannot believe it," said the fisherman.  "That vase could not
contain one of your feet even, and how could your whole body go in?  I
cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing."

Then the genius began to change himself into smoke, which, as before,
spread over the sea and the shore, and which, then collecting itself
together, began to go back into the vase slowly and evenly till there
was nothing left outside.  Then a voice came from the vase which said
to the fisherman, "Well, unbelieving fisherman, here I am in the vase;
do you believe me now?"

"Now, O genius," he cried, "ask pardon of me, and choose by what death
you will die!  But no, it will be better if I throw you into the sea
whence I drew you out, and I will build a house on the shore to warn
fishermen who come to cast their nets here, against fishing up such a
wicked genius as you are, who vows to kill the man who frees you."

At these words the genius did all he could to get out, but he could
not, because of the enchantment of the lid.

"No," answered the fisherman, "if I trust myself to you I am afraid you
will treat me as a certain Greek king treated the physician Douban.
Listen, and I will tell you."

In the country of Zouman, in Persia, there lived a Greek king.  This
king was a leper, and all his doctors had been unable to cure him, when
a very clever physician came to his court.

As soon as he was told of the king''s illness he put on his best robe
and presented himself before the king.  "Sire," said he, "I know that
no physician has been able to cure your majesty, but if you will follow
my instructions, I will promise to cure you without any medicines or
outward application."

"If you are clever enough to do this," he said, "I promise to make you
and your descendants rich for ever."

The physician went to his house and made a polo club, the handle of
which he hollowed out, and put in it the drug he wished to use.  Then
he made a ball, and with these things he went the next day to the king.

He told him that he wished him to play at polo.  Accordingly the king
mounted his horse and went into the place where he played.  There the
physician approached him with the bat he had made, saying, "Take this,
sire, and strike the ball till you feel your hand and whole body in a
glow.  When the remedy that is in the handle of the club is warmed by
your hand it will penetrate throughout your body.  The you must return
to your palace, bathe, and go to sleep, and when you awake to-morrow
morning you will be cured."

The king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which he had
thrown.  He struck it, and then it was hit back by the courtiers who
were playing with him.  When he felt very hot he stopped playing, and
went back to the palace, went into the bath, and did all that the
physician had said.  The next day when he arose he found, to his great
joy and astonishment, that he was completely cured.  When he entered
his audience-chamber all his courtiers, who were eager to see if the
wonderful cure had been effected, were overwhelmed with joy.

The physician Douban entered the hall and bowed low to the ground.  The
king, seeing him, called him, made him sit by his side, and showed him
every mark of honour.

That evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state, and presented
him with two thousand sequins.  The following day he continued to load
him with favours.

Now the king had a grand-vizir who was avaricious, and envious, and a
very bad man.  He grew extremely jealous of the physician, and
determined to bring about his ruin.

In order to do this he asked to speak in private with the king, saying
that he had a most important communication to make.

"Sire," answered the grand-vizir, "it is most dangerous for a monarch
to confide in a man whose faithfulness is not proved, You do not know
that this physician is not a traitor come here to assassinate you."

"I am sure," said the king, "that this man is the most faithful and
virtuous of men.  If he wished to take my life, why did he cure me?
Cease to speak against him.  I see what it is, you are jealous of him;
but do not think that I can be turned against him.  I remember well
what a vizir said to King Sindbad, his master, to prevent him from
putting the prince, his son, to death."

What the Greek king said excited the vizir''s curiosity, and he said to
him, "Sire, I beg your majesty to have the condescension to tell me
what the vizir said to King Sindbad."

"This vizir," he replied, "told King Sindbad that one ought not believe
everything that a mother-in-law says, and told him this story."

A good man had a beautiful wife, whom he loved passionately, and never
left if possible.  One day, when he was obliged by important business
to go away from her, he went to a place where all kinds of birds are
sold and bought a parrot.  This parrot not only spoke well, but it had
the gift of telling all that had been done before it.  He brought it
home in a cage, and asked his wife to put it in her room, and take
great care of it while he was away.  Then he departed.  On his return
he asked the parrot what had happened during his absence, and the
parrot told him some things which made him scold his wife.

She thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales of her,
but they told her it was the parrot, and she resolved to revenge
herself on him.

When her husband next went away for one day, she told on slave to turn
under the bird''s cage a hand-mill; another to throw water down from
above the cage, and a third to take a mirror and turn it in front of
its eyes, from left to right by the light of a candle.  The slaves did
this for part of the night, and did it very well.

The next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot what he had
seen.  The bird replied, "My good master, the lightning, thunder and
rain disturbed me so much all night long, that I cannot tell you what I
have suffered."

The husband, who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered in the
night, was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the truth, so he
took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on the ground that he
killed him.  Nevertheless he was sorry afterwards, for he found that
the parrot had spoken the truth.

"When the Greek king," said the fisherman to the genius, "had finished
the story of the parrot, he added to the vizir, "And so, vizir, I shall
not listen to you, and I shall take care of the physician, in case I
repent as the husband did when he had killed the parrot."  But the
vizir was determined.  "Sire," he replied, "the death of the parrot was
nothing.  But when it is a question of the life of a king it is better
to sacrifice the innocent than save the guilty.  It is no uncertain
thing, however.  The physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you.  My
zeal prompts me to disclose this to your Majesty.  If I am wrong, I
deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished."  "What had the
vizir done," said the Greek king, "to merit the punishment?" "I will
tell your Majesty, if you will do me the honour to listen," answered
the vizir."

There was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond of
hunting.  He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime, but he had
ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him, and never to lose sight
of him.  One day the huntsman roused a stag, and the prince, thinking
that the vizir was behind, gave chase, and rode so hard that he found
himself alone.  He stopped, and having lost sight of it, he turned to
rejoin the vizir, who had not been careful enough to follow him.  But
he lost his way.  Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side
of the road a beautiful lady who was crying bitterly.  He drew his
horse''s rein, and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this
place, and if she needed help.  "I am the daughter of an Indian king,"
she answered, "and whilst riding in the country I fell asleep and
tumbled off.  My horse has run away, and I do not know what has become
of him."

The young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind him,
which he did.  As they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted
and went in.  The prince also dismounted and followed her.  To his
great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside, "Rejoice my
children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth."  And other voices
replied, "Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at once, as we are
very hungry?"

The prince at once saw the danger he was in.  He now knew that the lady
who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an ogress, who
lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprised and
devoured passers-by. He was terrified, and threw himself on his horse.
The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeing that she had
lost her prey, she said to him, "Do not be afraid.  What do you want?"

The prince could hardly believe his ears, and rode off as hard as he
could.  He found his way, and arrived safe and sound at his father''s
house, where he told him of the danger he had run because of the
grand-vizir''s carelessness.  The king was very angry, and had him
strangled immediately.

"Sire," went on the vizir to the Greek king, "to return to the
physician, Douban.  If you do not take care, you will repent of having
trusted him.  Who knows what this remedy, with which he has cured you,
may not in time have a bad effect on you?"

The Greek king was naturally very weak, and did not perceive the wicked
intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keep to his first
resolution.

"Well, vizir," he said, "you are right.  Perhaps he did come to take my
life.  He might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs.  I must
see what can be done."

"The best means, sire, to put your life in security, is to send for him
at once, and to cut off his head directly he comes," said the vizir.

"I have learnt," replied the king, "that you are a spy, and intend to
kill me.  But I will be first, and kill you.  Strike," he added to an
executioner who was by, "and rid me of this assassin."

At this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees.  "Spare
my life," he cried, "and yours will be spared."

The fisherman stopped here to say to the genius:  "You see what passed
between the Greek king and the physician has just passed between us
two.  The Greek king," he went on, "had no mercy on him, and the
executioner bound his eyes."

The physician on his knees, and bound, said to the king: "At least let
me put my affairs in order, and leave my books to persons who will make
good use of them.  There is one which I should like to present to your
majesty.  It is very precious, and ought to be kept carefully in your
treasury.  It contains many curious things the chief being that when
you cut off my head, if your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf, and
read the third line of the left-hand page, my head will answer all the
questions you like to ask it."

The king, eager to see such a wonderful thing, put off his execution to
the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his house.  There
the physician put his affairs in order, and the next day there was a
great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death, and the doings
after it.  The physician went up to the foot of the throne with a large
book in his hand.  He carried a basin, on which he spread the covering
of the book, and presenting it to the king, said:  "Sire, take this
book, and when my head is cut off, let it be placed in the basin on the
covering of this book; as soon as it is there, the blood will cease to
flow.  Then open the book, and my head will answer your questions.
But, sire, I implore your mercy, for I am innocent."

"Your prayers are useless, and if it were only to hear your head speak
when you are dead, you should die."

The head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin, and
directly the blood ceased to flow.  Then, to the great astonishment of
the king, the eyes opened, and the head said, "Your majesty, open the
book."  The king did so, and finding that the first leaf stuck against
the second, he put his finger in his mouth, to turn it more easily.  He
did the same thing till he reached the sixth page, and not seeing any
writing on it, "Physician," he said, "there is no writing."

"Turn over a few more pages," answered the head.  The king went on
turning, still putting his finger in his mouth, till the poison in
which each page was dipped took effect.  His sight failed him, and he
fell at the foot of his throne.

When the physician''s head saw that the poison had taken effect, and
that the king had only a few more minutes to live, "Tyrant," it cried,
"see how cruelty and injustice are punished."

Scarcely had it uttered these words than the king died, and the head
lost also the little life that had remained in it.

That is the end of the story of the Greek king, and now let us return
to the fisherman and the genius.

"If the Greek king," said the fisherman, "had spared the physician, he
would not have thus died.  The same thing applies to you.  Now I am
going to throw you into the sea."

"My friend," said the genius, "do not do such a cruel thing.  Do not
treat me as Imma treated Ateca."

"Do you think I can tell you while I am shut up in here?" replied the
genius.  "Let me out, and I will make you rich."

"If you will give me your promise to do this, I will open the lid.  I
do not think you will dare to break your word."

The genius promised, and the fisherman lifted the lid.  He came out at
once in smoke, and then, having resumed his proper form, the first
thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea.  This frightened the
fisherman, but the genius laughed and said, "Do not be afraid; I only
did it to frighten you, and to show you that I intend to keep my word;
take your nets and follow me."

He began to walk in front of the fisherman, who followed him with some
misgivings.  They passed in front of the town, and went up a mountain
and then down into a great plain, where there was a large lake lying
between four hills.

The fisherman did as he was told, hoping for a good catch, as he saw
plenty of fish.  What was his astonishment at seeing that there were
four quite different kinds, some white, some red, some blue, and some
yellow.  He caught four, one of each colour.  As he had never seen any
like them he admired them very much, and he was very pleased to think
how much money he would get for them.

"Take these fish and carry them to the Sultan, who will give you more
money for them than you have ever had in your life.  You can come every
day to fish in this lake, but be careful not to throw your nets more
than once every day, otherwise some harm will happen to you.  If you
follow my advice carefully you will find it good."

Saying these words, he struck his foot against the ground, which
opened, and when he had disappeared, it closed immediately.

The fisherman resolved to obey the genius exactly, so he did not cast
his nets a second time, but walked into the town to sell his fish at
the palace.

When the Sultan saw the fish he was much astonished.  He looked at them
one after the other, and when he had admired them long enough, "Take
these fish," he said to his first vizir, "and given them to the clever
cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent me.  I think they must be as good
as they are beautiful."

The vizir took them himself to the cook, saying, "Here are four fish
that have been brought to the Sultan.  He wants you to cook them."

Then he went back to the Sultan, who told him to give the fisherman
four hundred gold pieces.  The fisherman, who had never before
possessed such a large sum of money at once, could hardly believe his
good fortune.  He at once relieved the needs of his family, and made
good use of it.

But now we must return to the kitchen, which we shall find in great
confusion.  The cook, when she had cleaned the fish, put them in a pan
with some oil to fry them.  When she thought them cooked enough on one
side she turned them on the other.  But scarcely had she done so when
the walls of the kitchen opened, and there came out a young and
beautiful damsel.  She was dressed in an Egyptian dress of flowered
satin, and she wore earrings, and a necklace of white pearls, and
bracelets of gold set with rubies, and she held a wand of myrtle in her
hand.

She went up to the pan, to the great astonishment of the cook, who
stood motionless at the sight of her.  She struck one of the fish with
her rod, "Fish, fish," said she, "are you doing your duty?" The fish
answered nothing, and then she repeated her question, whereupon they
all raised their heads together and answered very distinctly, "Yes,
yes.  If you reckon, we reckon.  If you pay your debts, we pay ours.
If you fly, we conquer, and we are content."

When they had spoken the girl upset the pan, and entered the opening in
the wall, which at once closed, and appeared the same as before.

When the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted up the fish
which had fallen into the ashes, but she found them as black as
cinders, and not fit to serve up to the Sultan.  She began to cry.

"Alas! what shall I say to the Sultan?  He will be so angry with me,
and I know he will not believe me!"

Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and asked if the fish
were ready.  She told him all that had happened, and he was much
surprised.  He sent at once for the fisherman, and when he came said to
him, "Fisherman, bring me four more fish like you have brought already,
for an accident has happened to them so that they cannot be served up
to the Sultan."

The fisherman did not say what the genius had told him, but he excused
himself from bringing them that day on account of the length of the
way, and he promised to bring them next day.

In the night he went to the lake, cast his nets, and on drawing them in
found four fish, which were like the others, each of a different colour.

He then took them to the kitchen and shut himself up with the cook, who
began to cook them as she had done the four others on the previous day.
When she was about to turn them on the other side, the wall opened, the
damsel appeared, addressed the same words to the fish, received the
same answer, and then overturned the pan and disappeared.

The grand-vizir was filled with astonishment.  "I shall tell the Sultan
all that has happened," said he.  And he did so.

The Sultan was very much astounded, and wished to see this marvel for
himself.  So he sent for the fisherman, and asked him to procure four
more fish.  The fisherman asked for three days, which were granted, and
he then cast his nets in the lake, and again caught four different
coloured fish.  The sultan was delighted to see he had got them, and
gave him again four hundred gold pieces.

As soon as the Sultan had the fish he had them carried to his room with
all that was needed to cook them.

Then he shut himself up with the grand-vizir, who began to prepare them
and cook them.  When they were done on one side he turned them over on
the other.  Then the wall of the room opened, but instead of the maiden
a black slave came out.  He was enormously tall, and carried a large
green stick with which he touched the fish, saying in a terrible voice,
"Fish, fish, are you doing your duty?" To these words the fish lifting
up their heads replied, "Yes, yes.  If you reckon, we reckon.  If you
pay your debts, we pay ours.  If you fly, we conquer, and are content."

The black slave overturned the pan in the middle of the room, and the
fish were turned to cinders.  Then he stepped proudly back into the
wall, which closed round him.

"After having seen this," said the Sultan, "I cannot rest.  These fish
signify some mystery I must clear up."

He sent for the fisherman.  "Fisherman," he said, "the fish you have
brought us have caused me some anxiety.  Where did you get them from?"

"Sire," he answered, "I got them from a lake which lies in the middle
of four hills beyond yonder mountains."

"No; though I have hunted many times round that mountain, I have never
heard of it," said the vizir.

As the fisherman said it was only three hours'' journey away, the sultan
ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither, and the fisherman
led them.

They climbed the mountain, and then, on the other side, saw the lake as
the fisherman had described.  The water was so clear that they could
see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it.  They looked at them
for some time, and then the Sultan ordered them to make a camp by the
edge of the water.

When night came the Sultan called his vizir, and said to him, "I have
resolved to clear up this mystery.  I am going out alone, and do you
stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow, say I am
not well, and cannot see them.  Do this each day till I return."

The grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not to go, but in vain.
The Sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword, and when he
saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone.

He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed the great plain, till,
just as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a large building.
When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of beautiful
black polished marble, covered with steel as smooth as a mirror.

He went to the gate, which stood half open, and went in, as nobody came
when he knocked.  He passed through a magnificent courtyard and still
saw no one, though he called aloud several times.

He entered large halls where the carpets were of silk, the lounges and
sofas covered with tapestry from Mecca, and the hangings of the most
beautiful Indian stuffs of gold and silver.  Then he found himself in a
splendid room, with a fountain supported by golden lions.  The water
out of the lions'' mouths turned into diamonds and pearls, and the
leaping water almost touched a most beautifully-painted dome.  The
palace was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens, little
lakes, and woods.  Birds sang in the trees, which were netted over to
keep them always there.

Still the Sultan saw no one, till he heard a plaintive cry, and a voice
which said, "Oh that I could die, for I am too unhappy to wish to live
any longer!"

The Sultan looked round to discover who it was who thus bemoaned his
fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly clothed, who was
sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground.  His face was very
sad.

The sultan approached him and bowed to him.  The young man bent his
head very low, but did not rise.

"Sire," he said to the Sultan, "I cannot rise and do you the reverence
that I am sure should be paid to your rank."

"Sir," answered the Sultan, "I am sure you have a good reason for not
doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am come to offer you
my help.  Whose is this palace, and why is it thus empty?"

Instead of answering the young man lifted up his robe, and showed the
Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block of black marble.

You must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of this
country, the Black Isles, so called from the four little mountains
which were once islands, while the capital was the place where now the
great lake lies.  My story will tell you how these changes came about.

My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him.  I married
my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she loved me too.

But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fanned by two
of her maids, I heard one say to the other, "What a pity it is that our
mistress no longer loves our master!  I believe she would like to kill
him if she could, for she is an enchantress."

I soon found by watching that they were right, and when I mortally
wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime, she begged that
she might build a palace in the garden, where she wept and bewailed him
for two years.

At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he could
not speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him alive.  She
turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words, and I
instantly became as you see me now, half man and half marble.

Then this wicked enchantress changed the capital, which was a very
populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desert plain you saw.
The fish of four colours which are in it are the different races who
lived in the town; the four hills are the four islands which give the
name to my kingdom.  All this the enchantress told me to add to my
troubles.  And this is not all.  Every day she comes and beats me with
a whip of buffalo hide.

When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once more into
tears, and the Sultan was much moved.

"Tell me," he cried, "where is this wicked woman, and where is the
miserable object of her affection, whom she just manages to keep alive?"

"Where she lives I do not know," answered the unhappy prince, "but she
goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak to her,
after she has beaten me."

So he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring this
about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effect the next day.
The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave himself up to happy
hopes of release.  The next day the Sultan arose, and then went to the
palace in the garden where the black slave was.  He drew his sword and
destroyed the little life that remained in him, and then threw the body
down a well.  He then lay down on the couch where the slave had been,
and waited for the enchantress.

She came near his couch and said, "Are you better to-day, my dear
slave?  Speak but one word to me."

"How can I be better," answered the Sultan, imitating the language of
the Ethiopians, "when I can never sleep for the cries and groans of
your husband?"

The queen at once went out and took a cup of water, and said over it
some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire.  Then she threw
it over the prince, who at once regained his own form.  He was filled
with joy, but the enchantress said, "Hasten away from this place and
never come back, lest I kill you."

"What you have done," said the Sultan, "is not enough to cure me.
Every day at midnight all the people whom you have changed into fish
lift their heads out of the lake and cry for vengeance.  Go quickly,
and give them their proper shape."

The fish then became men, women, and children, and the houses and shops
were once more filled.  The Sultan''s suite, who had encamped by the
lake, were not a little astonished to see themselves in the middle of a
large and beautiful town.

"And now," said the Sultan.  "I will go back to my capital, which I am
glad to find is so near yours."

"Do you know it is a whole year''s journey from here?  You came here in
a few hours because it was enchanted.  But I will accompany you on your
journey."

"It will give me much pleasure if you will escort me," said the Sultan,
"and as I have no children, I will make you my heir."

The Sultan and the prince set out together, the Sultan laden with rich
presents from the King of the Black Isles.

The day after he reached his capital the Sultan assembled his court and
told them all that had befallen him, and told them how he intended to
adopt the young king as his heir.

As for the fisherman, as he was the first cause of the deliverance of
the young prince, the Sultan gave him much money, and made him and his
family happy for the rest of their days.

In the reign of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at Bagdad a
porter who, in spite of his humble calling, was an intelligent and
sensible man.  One morning he was sitting in his usual place with his
basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a tall young lady, covered
with a long muslin veil, came up to him and said, "Pick up your basket
and follow me."  The porter, who was greatly pleased by her appearance
and voice, jumped up at once, poised his basket on his head, and
accompanied the lady, saying to himself as he went, "Oh, happy day!
Oh, lucky meeting!"

The lady soon stopped before a closed door, at which she knocked.  It
was opened by an old man with a long white beard, to whom the lady held
out money without speaking.  The old man, who seemed to understand what
she wanted, vanished into the house, and returned bringing a large jar
of wine, which the porter placed in his basket.  Then the lady signed
to him to follow, and they went their way.

The next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and here she
bought a large quantity of apples, apricots, peaches, and other things,
with lilies, jasmine, and all sorts of sweet-smelling plants.  From
this shop she went to a butcher''s, a grocer''s, and a poulterer''s, till
at last the porter exclaimed in despair, "My good lady, if you had only
told me you were going to buy enough provisions to stock a town, I
would have brought a horse, or rather a camel." The lady laughed, and
told him she had not finished yet, but after choosing various kinds of
scents and spices from a druggist''s store, she halted before a
magnificent palace, at the door of which she knocked gently.  The
porteress who opened it was of such beauty that the eyes of the man
were quite dazzled, and he was the more astonished as he saw clearly
that she was no slave.  The lady who had led him hither stood watching
him with amusement, till the porteress exclaimed, "Why don''t you come
in, my sister?  This poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is
ready to drop."

When they were both inside the door was fastened, and they all three
entered a large court, surrounded by an open-work gallery.  At one end
of the court was a platform, and on the platform stood an amber throne
supported by four ebony columns, garnished with pearls and diamonds.
In the middle of the court stood a marble basin filled with water from
the mouth of a golden lion.

The porter looked about him, noticing and admiring everything; but his
attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the
throne, who was even more beautiful than the other two.  By the respect
shown to her by the others, he judged that she must be the eldest, and
in this he was right.  This lady''s name was Zobeida, the porteress was
Sadie, and the housekeeper was Amina.  At a word from Zobeida, Sadie
and Amina took the basket from the porter, who was glad enough to be
relieved from its weight; and when it was emptied, paid him handsomely
for its use.  But instead of taking up his basket and going away, the
man still lingered, till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for, and
if he expected more money.  "Oh, madam," returned he, "you have already
given me too much, and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not
taking my departure at once.  But, if you will pardon my saying so, I
was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves.
A company of women without men is, however, as dull as a company of men
without women."  And after telling some stories to prove his point, he
ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a fourth at their
dinner.

The ladies were rather amused at the man''s assurances and after some
discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay, as his
society might prove entertaining.  "But listen, friend," said Zobeida,
"if we grant your request, it is only on condition that you behave with
the utmost politeness, and that you keep the secret of our way of
living, which chance has revealed to you." Then they all sat down to
table, which had been covered by Amina with the dishes she had bought.

After the first few mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a golden cup.
She first drank herself, according to the Arab custom, and then filled
it for her sisters.  When it came to the porter''s turn he kissed
Amina''s hand, and sang a song, which he composed at the moment in
praise of the wine.  The three ladies were pleased with the song, and
then sang themselves, so that the repast was a merry one, and lasted
much longer than usual.

At length, seeing that the sun was about to set, Sadia said to the
porter, "Rise and go; it is now time for us to separate."

"Oh, madam," replied he, "how can you desire me to quit you in the
state in which I am?  Between the wine I have drunk, and the pleasure
of seeing you, I should never find the way to my house.  Let me remain
here till morning, and when I have recovered my senses I will go when
you like."

"Let him stay," said Amina, who had before proved herself his friend.
"It is only just, as he has given us so much amusement."

"If you wish it, my sister," replied Zobeida; "but if he does, I must
make a new condition.  Porter," she continued, turning to him, "if you
remain, you must promise to ask no questions about anything you may
see.  If you do, you may perhaps hear what you don''t like."

This being settled, Amina brought in supper, and lit up the hall with a
number of sweet smelling tapers.  They then sat down again at the
table, and began with fresh appetites to eat, drink, sing, and recite
verses.  In fact, they were all enjoying themselves mightily when they
heard a knock at the outer door, which Sadie rose to open.  She soon
returned saying that three Calenders, all blind in the right eye, and
all with their heads, faces, and eyebrows clean shaved, begged for
admittance, as they were newly arrived in Bagdad, and night had already
fallen.  "They seem to have pleasant manners," she added, "but you have
no idea how funny they look.  I am sure we should find their company
diverting."

Zobeida and Amina made some difficulty about admitting the new comers,
and Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation.  But she urged the
matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to consent.  "Bring
them in, then," said she, "but make them understand that they are not
to make remarks about what does not concern them, and be sure to make
them read the inscription over the door." For on the door was written
in letters of gold, "Whoso meddles in affairs that are no business of
his, will hear truths that will not please him."

The three Calenders bowed low on entering, and thanked the ladies for
their kindness and hospitality.  The ladies replied with words of
welcome, and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyes of
the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not so very unlike
their own, though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him.
"This," said one of them, "is apparently one of our Arab brothers, who
has rebelled against our ruler."

The porter, although half asleep from the wine he had drunk, heard the
words, and without moving cried angrily to the Calender, "Sit down and
mind your own business.  Did you not read the inscription over the
door?  Everybody is not obliged to live in the same way."

"Do not be so angry, my good man," replied the Calender; "we should be
very sorry to displease you;" so the quarrel was smoothed over, and
supper began in good earnest.  When the Calenders had satisfied their
hunger, they offered to play to their hostesses, if there were any
instruments in the house.  The ladies were delighted at the idea, and
Sadie went to see what she could find, returning in a few moments laden
with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine.  Each Calender
took the one he preferred, and began to play a well-known air, while
the ladies sang the words of the song.  These words were the gayest and
liveliest possible, and every now and then the singers had to stop to
indulge the laughter which almost choked them.  In the midst of all
their noise, a knock was heard at the door.

Now early that evening the Caliph secretly left the palace, accompanied
by his grand-vizir, Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs, all
three wearing the dresses of merchants.  Passing down the street, the
Caliph had been attracted by the music of instruments and the sound of
laughter, and had ordered his vizir to go and knock at the door of the
house, as he wished to enter.  The vizir replied that the ladies who
lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends, and he thought his
master would do well not to intrude on them; but the Caliph had taken
it into his head to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed.

The knock was answered by Sadie, with a taper in her hand, and the
vizir, who was surprised at her beauty, bowed low before her, and said
respectfully, "Madam, we are three merchants who have lately arrived
from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure which befel us this very
night, only reached our inn to find that the doors were closed to us
till to-morrow morning.  Not knowing what to do, we wandered in the
streets till we happened to pass your house, when, seeing lights and
hearing the sound of voices, we resolved to ask you to give us shelter
till the dawn.  If you will grant us this favour, we will, with your
permission, do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly."

Sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters;
and after having talked over the matter with them, she returned to tell
him that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company.
They entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests.  Then
Zobeida, as the mistress, came forward and said gravely, "You are
welcome here, but I hope you will allow me to beg one thing of
you--have as many eyes as you like, but no tongues; and ask no
questions about anything you see, however strange it may appear to you."

"Madam," returned the vizir, "you shall be obeyed.  We have quite
enough to please and interest us without troubling ourselves about that
with which we have no concern."  Then they all sat down, and drank to
the health of the new comers.

While the vizir, Giafar, was talking to the ladies the Caliph was
occupied in wondering who they could be, and why the three Calenders
had each lost his right eye.  He was burning to inquire the reason of
it all, but was silenced by Zobeida''s request, so he tried to rouse
himself and to take his part in the conversation, which was very
lively, the subject of discussion being the many different sorts of
pleasures that there were in the world.  After some time the Calenders
got up and performed some curious dances, which delighted the rest of
the company.

When they had finished Zobeida rose from her seat, and, taking Amina by
the hand, she said to her, "My sister, our friends will excuse us if we
seem to forget their presence and fulfil our nightly task." Amina
understood her sister''s meaning, and collecting the dishes, glasses,
and musical instruments, she carried them away, while Sadie swept the
hall and put everything in order.  Having done this she begged the
Calenders to sit on a sofa on one side of the room, and the Caliph and
his friends to place themselves opposite.  As to the porter, she
requested him to come and help her and her sister.

Shortly after Amina entered carrying a seat, which she put down in the
middle of the empty space.  She next went over to the door of a closet
and signed to the porter to follow her.  He did so, and soon reappeared
leading two black dogs by a chain, which he brought into the centre of
the hall.  Zobeida then got up from her seat between the Calenders and
the Caliph and walked slowly across to where the porter stood with the
dogs.  "We must do our duty," she said with a deep sigh, pushing back
her sleeves, and, taking a whip from Sadie, she said to the man, "Take
one of those dogs to my sister Amina and give me the other."

The porter did as he was bid, but as he led the dog to Zobeida it
uttered piercing howls, and gazed up at her with looks of entreaty.
But Zobeida took no notice, and whipped the dog till she was out of
breath.  She then took the chain from the porter, and, raising the dog
on its hind legs, they looked into each other''s eyes sorrowfully till
tears began to fall from both.  Then Zobeida took her handkerchief and
wiped the dog''s eyes tenderly, after which she kissed it, then, putting
the chain into the porter''s hand she said, "Take it back to the closet
and bring me the other."

The same ceremony was gone through with the second dog, and all the
while the whole company looked on with astonishment.  The Caliph in
particular could hardly contain himself, and made signs to the vizir to
ask what it all meant.  But the vizir pretended not to see, and turned
his head away.

Zobeida remained for some time in the middle of the room, till at last
Sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down, as she also had her
part to play.  At these words Amina fetched a lute from a case of
yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang several songs to its
accompaniment.  When she was tired she said to Amina, "My sister, I can
do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place."

Amina struck a few chords and then broke into a song, which she sang
with so much ardour that she was quite overcome, and sank gasping on a
pile of cushions, tearing open her dress as she did so to give herself
some air.  To the amazement of all present, her neck, instead of being
as smooth and white as her face, was a mass of scars.

The Calenders and the Caliph looked at each other, and whispered
together, unheard by Zobeida and Sadie, who were tending their fainting
sister.

"My lord," answered all the Calenders together, "we came here for the
first time an hour before you."

They then turned to the porter to see if he could explain the mystery,
but the porter was no wiser than they were themselves.  At length the
Caliph could contain his curiosity no longer, and declared that he
would compel the ladies to tell them the meaning of their strange
conduct.  The vizir, foreseeing what would happen, implored him to
remember the condition their hostesses had imposed, and added in a
whisper that if his Highness would only wait till morning he could as
Caliph summon the ladies to appear before him.  But the Caliph, who was
not accustomed to be contradicted, rejected this advice, and it was
resolved after a little more talking that the question should be put by
the porter.  Suddenly Zobeida turned round, and seeing their excitement
she said, "What is the matter--what are you all discussing so
earnestly?"

"Madam," answered the porter, "these gentlemen entreat you to explain
to them why you should first whip the dogs and then cry over them, and
also how it happens that the fainting lady is covered with scars.  They
have requested me, Madam, to be their mouthpiece."

"Is it true, gentlemen," asked Zobeida, drawing herself up, "that you
have charged this man to put me that question?"

"Is this," continued Zobeida, growing more angry every moment, "is this
the return you make for the hospitality I have shown you?  Have you
forgotten the one condition on which you were allowed to enter the
house?  Come quickly," she added, clapping her hands three times, and
the words were hardly uttered when seven black slaves, each armed with
a sabre, burst in and stood over the seven men, throwing them on the
ground, and preparing themselves, on a sign from their mistress, to cut
off their heads.

The seven culprits all thought their last hour had come, and the Caliph
repented bitterly that he had not taken the vizir''s advice.  But they
made up their minds to die bravely, all except the porter, who loudly
inquired of Zobeida why he was to suffer for other people''s faults, and
declared that these misfortunes would never have happened if it had not
been for the Calenders, who always brought ill-luck. He ended by
imploring Zobeida not to confound the innocent with the guilty and to
spare his life.

In spite of her anger, there was something so comic in the groans of
the porter that Zobeida could not refrain from laughing.  But putting
him aside she addressed the others a second time, saying, "Answer me;
who are you?  Unless you tell me truly you have not another moment to
live.  I can hardly think you are men of any position, whatever country
you belong to.  If you were, you would have had more consideration for
us."

The Caliph, who was naturally very impatient, suffered far more than
either of the others at feeling that his life was at the mercy of a
justly offended lady, but when he heard her question he began to
breathe more freely, for he was convinced that she had only to learn
his name and rank for all danger to be over.  So he whispered hastily
to the vizir, who was next to him, to reveal their secret.  But the
vizir, wiser than his master, wished to conceal from the public the
affront they had received, and merely answered, "After all, we have
only got what we deserved."

Meanwhile Zobeida had turned to the three Calenders and inquired if, as
they were all blind, they were brothers.

"No, madam," returned he, "I became blind through a most surprising
adventure, such as probably has never happened to anybody.  After that
I shaved my head and eyebrows and put on the dress in which you see me
now."

"But," added the third, "it may interest you, madam, to know that we
are not men of low birth, but are all three sons of kings, and of
kings, too, whom the world holds in high esteem."

At these words Zobeida''s anger cooled down, and she turned to her
slaves and said, "You can give them a little more liberty, but do not
leave the hall.  Those that will tell us their histories and their
reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt; those who
refuse--" And she paused, but in a moment the porter, who understood
that he had only to relate his story to set himself free from this
terrible danger, immediately broke in,

"Madam, you know already how I came here, and what I have to say will
soon be told.  Your sister found me this morning in the place where I
always stand waiting to be hired.  She bade me follow her to various
shops, and when my basket was quite full we returned to this house,
when you had the goodness to permit me to remain, for which I shall be
eternally grateful.  That is my story."

He looked anxiously to Zobeida, who nodded her head and said, "You can
go; and take care we never meet again."

"Oh, madam," cried the porter, "let me stay yet a little while.  It is
not just that the others should have heard my story and that I should
not hear theirs," and without waiting for permission he seated himself
on the end of the sofa occupied by the ladies, whilst the rest crouched
on the carpet, and the slaves stood against the wall.

In order, madam, to explain how I came to lose my right eye, and to
wear the dress of a Calender, you must first know that I am the son of
a king.  My father''s only brother reigned over the neighbouring
country, and had two children, a daughter and a son, who were of the
same age as myself.

As I grew up, and was allowed more liberty, I went every year to pay a
visit to my uncle''s court, and usually stayed there about two months.
In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were much
attached to each other.  The very last time I saw him he seemed more
delighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour.
When we had finished eating, he said to me, "My cousin, you would never
guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us!  Directly
after your departure I set a number of men to work on a building after
my own design.  It is now completed, and ready to be lived in.  I
should like to show it to you, but you must first swear two things: to
be faithful to me, and to keep my secret."

Of course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gave
the promise without the least hesitation.  He then bade me wait an
instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richly dressed
lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name, I thought it
was better not to inquire.  We all three sat down to table and amused
ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things, and with
drinking each other''s health.  Suddenly the prince said to me, "Cousin,
we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this lady to a
certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built.  You
cannot mistake it.  Go in, both of you, and wait till I come.  I shall
not be long."

As I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my hand to
the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the place of
which the prince had spoken.  We had barely reached it when he joined
us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe, and a little
bag containing plaster.

With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre in the
middle of the tomb.  One by one he took the stones and piled them up in
a corner.  When he had knocked down the whole sepulchre he proceeded to
dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchre had been I saw a
trap-door. He raised the door and I caught sight of the top of a spiral
staircase; then he said, turning to the lady, "Madam, this is the way
that will lead you down to the spot which I told you of."

The lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase, the
prince following her.  At the top, however, he looked at me.  "My
cousin," he exclaimed, "I do not know how to thank you for your
kindness.  Farewell."

He would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my room in
the palace and went to bed.  When I woke, and considered my adventure,
I thought that I must have been dreaming, and sent a servant to ask if
the prince was dressed and could see me.  But on hearing that he had
not slept at home I was much alarmed, and hastened to the cemetery,
where, unluckily, the tombs were all so alike that I could not discover
which was the one I was in search of, though I spent four days in
looking for it.

You must know that all this time the king, my uncle, was absent on a
hunting expedition, and as no one knew when he would be back, I at last
decided to return home, leaving the ministers to make my excuses.  I
longed to tell them what had become of the prince, about whose fate
they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath I had sworn kept me
silent.

On my arrival at my father''s capital, I was astonished to find a large
detachment of guards drawn up before the gate of the palace; they
surrounded me directly I entered.  I asked the officers in command the
reason of this strange behaviour, and was horrified to learn that the
army had mutinied and put to death the king, my father, and had placed
the grand-vizir on the throne.  Further, that by his orders I was
placed under arrest.

Now this rebel vizir had hated me from my boy-hood, because once, when
shooting at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by accident.  Of
course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regrets and
apologies, but I made them in person.  It was all of no use.  He
cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasion of showing
it.  Having once got me in his power I felt he could show no mercy, and
I was right.  Mad with triumph and fury he came to me in my prison and
tore out my right eye.  That is how I lost it.

My persecutor, however, did not stop here.  He shut me up in a large
case and ordered his executioner to carry me into a desert place, to
cut off my head, and then to abandon my body to the birds of prey.  The
case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a horse, and the
executioner, accompanied by another man, rode into the country until
they found a spot suitable for the purpose.  But their hearts were not
so hard as they seemed, and my tears and prayers made them waver.

"Forsake the kingdom instantly," said the executioner at last, "and
take care never to come back, for you will not only lose your head, but
make us lose ours."  I thanked him gratefully, and tried to console
myself for the loss of my eye by thinking of the other misfortunes I
had escaped.

After all I had gone through, and my fear of being recognised by some
enemy, I could only travel very slowly and cautiously, generally
resting in some out-of-the-way place by day, and walking as far as I
was able by night, but at length I arrived in the kingdom of my uncle,
of whose protection I was sure.

I found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son, who
had, he said, vanished without leaving a trace; but his own grief did
not prevent him sharing mine.  We mingled our tears, for the loss of
one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my mind that it was
my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to the prince.  I
therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything I knew, and I
observed that even before I had ended his sorrow appeared to be
lightened a little.

"My dear nephew," he said, "your story gives me some hope.  I was aware
that my son was building a tomb, and I think I can find the spot.  But
as he wished to keep the matter secret, let us go alone and seek the
place ourselves."

He then bade me disguise myself, and we both slipped out of a garden
door which opened on to the cemetery.  It did not take long for us to
arrive at the scene of the prince''s disappearance, or to discover the
tomb I had sought so vainly before.  We entered it, and found the
trap-door which led to the staircase, but we had great difficulty in
raising it, because the prince had fastened it down underneath with the
plaster he had brought with him.

My uncle went first, and I followed him.  When we reached the bottom of
the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante-room, filled with such a
dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see anything.  However, we
passed through the smoke into a large chamber, which at first seemed
quite empty.  The room was brilliantly lighted, and in another moment
we perceived a sort of platform at one end, on which were the bodies of
the prince and a lady, both half-burned, as if they had been dragged
out of a fire before it had quite consumed them.

This horrible sight turned me faint, but, to my surprise, my uncle did
not show so much surprise as anger.

"I knew," he said, "that my son was tenderly attached to this lady,
whom it was impossible he should ever marry.  I tried to turn his
thoughts, and presented to him the most beautiful princesses, but he
cared for none of them, and, as you see, they have now been united by a
horrible death in an underground tomb."  But, as he spoke, his anger
melted into tears, and again I wept with him.

When he recovered himself he drew me to him.  "My dear nephew," he
said, embracing me, "you have come to me to take his place, and I will
do my best to forget that I ever had a son who could act in so wicked a
manner."  Then he turned and went up the stairs.

We reached the palace without anyone having noticed our absence, when,
shortly after, a clashing of drums, and cymbals, and the blare of
trumpets burst upon our astonished ears.  At the same time a thick
cloud of dust on the horizon told of the approach of a great army.  My
heart sank when I perceived that the commander was the vizir who had
dethroned my father, and was come to seize the kingdom of my uncle.

The capital was utterly unprepared to stand a siege, and seeing that
resistance was useless, at once opened its gates.  My uncle fought hard
for his life, but was soon overpowered, and when he fell I managed to
escape through a secret passage, and took refuge with an officer whom I
knew I could trust.

Persecuted by ill-fortune, and stricken with grief, there seemed to be
only one means of safety left to me.  I shaved my beard and my
eyebrows, and put on the dress of a calender, in which it was easy for
me to travel without being known.  I avoided the towns till I reached
the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, when
I had no further reason to fear my enemies.  It was my intention to
come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness, who
would, I felt certain, be touched by my sad story, and would grant me,
besides, his help and protection.

After a journey which lasted some months I arrived at length at the
gates of this city.  It was sunset, and I paused for a little to look
about me, and to decide which way to turn my steps.  I was still
debating on this subject when I was joined by this other calender, who
stopped to greet me.  "You, like me, appear to be a stranger," I said.
He replied that I was right, and before he could say more the third
calender came up.  He, also, was newly arrived in Bagdad, and being
brothers in misfortune, we resolved to cast in our lots together, and
to share whatever fate might have in store.

By this time it had grown late, and we did not know where to spend the
night.  But our lucky star having guided us to this door, we took the
liberty of knocking and of asking for shelter, which was given to us at
once with the best grace in the world.

The calender, however, begged leave to stay and to hear the histories
of his two friends and of the three other persons of the company, which
he was allowed to do.

"Madam," said the young man, addressing Zobeida, "if you wish to know
how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the story of my whole
life."

I was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father, finding me
unusually quick and clever for my age, turned his thoughts to my
education.  I was taught first to read and write, and then to learn the
Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion, and the better to
understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest commentators on its
teaching, and committed to memory all the traditions respecting the
Prophet, which have been gathered from the mouth of those who were his
friends.  I also learnt history, and was instructed in poetry,
versification, geography, chronology, and in all the outdoor exercises
in which every prince should excel.  But what I liked best of all was
writing Arabic characters, and in this I soon surpassed my masters, and
gained a reputation in this branch of knowledge that reached as far as
India itself.

Now the Sultan of the Indies, curious to see a young prince with such
strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father, laden with rich
presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court.  My father, who was
deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so powerful a monarch, and
held besides that a little travel would greatly improve my manners and
open my mind, accepted gladly, and in a short time I had set out for
India with the ambassador, attended only by a small suite on account of
the length of the journey, and the badness of the roads.  However, as
was my duty, I took with me ten camels, laden with rich presents for
the Sultan.

We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud
of dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near, we
found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers.  Our men barely
numbered half, and as we were also hampered by the camels, there was no
use in fighting, so we tried to overawe them by informing them who we
were, and whither we were going.  The robbers, however, only laughed,
and declared that was none of their business, and, without more words,
attacked us brutally.  I defended myself to the last, wounded though I
was, but at length, seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the
ambassador and all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my
horse and rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead
from a wound in his side.  I managed to jump off without any injury,
and looked about to see if I was pursued.  But for the moment I was
safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in quarrelling
over their booty.

I found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and dared not
return to the main road lest I should again fall into the hands of the
robbers.  Luckily my wound was only a slight one, and after binding it
up as well as I could, I walked on for the rest of the day, till I
reached a cave at the foot of a mountain, where I passed the night in
peace, making my supper off some fruits I had gathered on the way.

I wandered about for a whole month without knowing where I was going,
till at length I found myself on the outskirts of a beautiful city,
watered by winding streams, which enjoyed an eternal spring.  My
delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human beings was
somewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object I must seem.  My
face and hands had been burned nearly black; my clothes were all in
rags, and my shoes were in such a state that I had been forced to
abandon them altogether.

I entered the town, and stopped at a tailor''s shop to inquire where I
was.  The man saw I was better than my condition, and begged me to sit
down, and in return I told him my whole story.  The tailor listened
with attention, but his reply, instead of giving me consolation, only
increased my trouble.

"Beware," he said, "of telling any one what you have told me, for the
prince who governs the kingdom is your father''s greatest enemy, and he
will be rejoiced to find you in his power."

I thanked the tailor for his counsel, and said I would do whatever he
advised; then, being very hungry, I gladly ate of the food he put
before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging in his house.

In a few days I had quite recovered from the hardships I had undergone,
and then the tailor, knowing that it was the custom for the princes of
our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to provide for
themselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired if there was anything I
could do for my living.  I replied that I had been educated as a
grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was writing.

"All that is of no use here," said the tailor.  "Take my advice, put on
a short coat, and as you seem hardy and strong, go into the woods and
cut firewood, which you will sell in the streets.  By this means you
will earn your living, and be able to wait till better times come.  The
hatchet and the cord shall be my present."

This counsel was very distasteful to me, but I thought I could not do
otherwise than adopt it.  So the next morning I set out with a company
of poor wood-cutters, to whom the tailor had introduced me.  Even on
the first day I cut enough wood to sell for a tolerable sum, and very
soon I became more expert, and had made enough money to repay the
tailor all he had lent me.

I had been a wood-cutter for more than a year, when one day I wandered
further into the forest than I had ever done before, and reached a
delicious green glade, where I began to cut wood.  I was hacking at the
root of a tree, when I beheld an iron ring fastened to a trapdoor of
the same metal.  I soon cleared away the earth, and pulling up the
door, found a staircase, which I hastily made up my mind to go down,
carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection.  When I reached the
bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace, as brilliantly lighted
as any palace above ground that I had ever seen, with a long gallery
supported by pillars of jasper, ornamented with capitals of gold.  Down
this gallery a lady came to meet me, of such beauty that I forgot
everything else, and thought only of her.

"By what accident do you come here?" she asked again with a sigh.  "I
have been in this place now for five and twenty years, and you are the
first man who has visited me."

Emboldened by her beauty and gentleness, I ventured to reply, "Before,
madam, I answer your question, allow me to say how grateful I am for
this meeting, which is not only a consolation to me in my own heavy
sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier," and then
I told her who I was, and how I had come there.

"Alas, prince," she said, with a deeper sigh than before, "you have
guessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this gorgeous
place.  I am the daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle, of whose fame
you surely must have heard.  At my father''s desire I was married to a
prince who was my own cousin; but on my very wedding day, I was
snatched up by a genius, and brought here in a faint.  For a long while
I did nothing but weep, and would not suffer the genius to come near
me; but time teaches us submission, and I have now got accustomed to
his presence, and if clothes and jewels could content me, I have them
in plenty.  Every tenth day, for five and twenty years, I have received
a visit from him, but in case I should need his help at any other time,
I have only to touch a talisman that stands at the entrance of my
chamber.  It wants still five days to his next visit, and I hope that
during that time you will do me the honour to be my guest."

I was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer,
and accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath, and a rich
dress befitting my rank was provided for me.  Then a feast of the most
delicate dishes was served in a room hung with embroidered Indian
fabrics.

Next day, when we were at dinner, I could maintain my patience no
longer, and implored the princess to break her bonds, and return with
me to the world which was lighted by the sun.

"What you ask is impossible," she answered; "but stay here with me
instead, and we can be happy, and all you will have to do is to betake
yourself to the forest every tenth day, when I am expecting my master
the genius.  He is very jealous, as you know, and will not suffer a man
to come near me."

"Princess," I replied, "I see it is only fear of the genius that makes
you act like this.  For myself, I dread him so little that I mean to
break his talisman in pieces!  Awful though you think him, he shall
feel the weight of my arm, and I herewith take a solemn vow to stamp
out the whole race."

The princess, who realized the consequences of such audacity, entreated
me not to touch the talisman.  "If you do, it will be the ruin of both
of us," said she; "I know genii much better than you." But the wine I
had drunk had confused my brain; I gave one kick to the talisman, and
it fell into a thousand pieces.

Hardly had my foot touched the talisman when the air became as dark as
night, a fearful noise was heard, and the palace shook to its very
foundations.  In an instant I was sobered, and understood what I had
done.  "Princess!"  I cried, "what is happening?"

I followed her advice and dashed up the staircase, leaving my hatchet
behind me.  But I was too late.  The palace opened and the genius
appeared, who, turning angrily to the princess, asked indignantly,

"A pain in my heart," she replied hastily, "obliged me to seek the aid
of this little bottle.  Feeling faint, I slipped and fell against the
talisman, which broke.  That is really all."

"I never saw them before," she answered, "and you came in such a hurry
that you may have picked them up on the road without knowing it."  To
this the genius only replied by insults and blows.  I could hear the
shrieks and groans of the princess, and having by this time taken off
my rich garments and put on those in which I had arrived the previous
day, I lifted the trap, found myself once more in the forest, and
returned to my friend the tailor, with a light load of wood and a heart
full of shame and sorrow.

The tailor, who had been uneasy at my long absence, was, delighted to
see me; but I kept silence about my adventure, and as soon as possible
retired to my room to lament in secret over my folly.  While I was thus
indulging my grief my host entered, and said, "There is an old man
downstairs who has brought your hatchet and slippers, which he picked
up on the road, and now restores to you, as he found out from one of
your comrades where you lived.  You had better come down and speak to
him yourself."  At this speech I changed colour, and my legs trembled
under me.  The tailor noticed my confusion, and was just going to
inquire the reason when the door of the room opened, and the old man
appeared, carrying with him my hatchet and shoes.

"I am a genius," he said, "the son of the daughter of Eblis, prince of
the genii.  Is not this hatchet yours, and these shoes?" Without
waiting for an answer--which, indeed, I could hardly have given him, so
great was my fright--he seized hold of me, and darted up into the air
with the quickness of lightning, and then, with equal swiftness,
dropped down towards the earth.  When he touched the ground, he rapped
it with his foot; it opened, and we found ourselves in the enchanted
palace, in the presence of the beautiful princess of the Ebony Isle.
But how different she looked from what she was when I had last seen
her, for she was lying stretched on the ground covered with blood, and
weeping bitterly.

She lifted up her eyes slowly, and looked sadly at me.  "I never saw
him before," she answered slowly.  "I do not know who he is."

"What!" exclaimed the genius, "you owe all your sufferings to him, and
yet you dare to say he is a stranger to you!"

"Alas," answered the princess, "I am too weak even to hold the sabre.
And supposing that I had the strength, why should I put an innocent man
to death?"

"You condemn yourself by your refusal," said the genius; then turning
to me, he added, "and you, do you not know her?"

"How should I?"  I replied, resolved to imitate the princess in her
fidelity.  "How should I, when I never saw her before?"

"Cut her head off," then, "if she is a stranger to you, and I shall
believe you are speaking the truth, and will set you at liberty."

"Certainly," I answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and making a
sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was my own life that I was
about to sacrifice, and not hers.  But the look of gratitude she gave
me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to the earth.

"I should not deserve to live," I said to the genius, "if I were such a
coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me, but who is at
this moment half dead herself.  Do with me as you will--I am in your
power--but I refuse to obey your cruel command."

"I see," said the genius, "that you have both made up your minds to
brave me, but I will give you a sample of what you may expect." So
saying, with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess,
who was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal farewell.
Then I lost consciousness for several minutes.

When I came to myself I implored the genius to keep me no longer in
this state of suspense, but to lose no time in putting an end to my
sufferings.  The genius, however, paid no attention to my prayers, but
said sternly, "That is the way in which a genius treats the woman who
has betrayed him.  If I chose, I could kill you also; but I will be
merciful, and content myself with changing you into a dog, an ass, a
lion, or a bird--whichever you prefer."

I caught eagerly at these words, as giving me a faint hope of softening
his wrath.  "O genius!"  I cried, "as you wish to spare my life, be
generous, and spare it altogether.  Grant my prayer, and pardon my
crime, as the best man in the whole world forgave his neighbour who was
eaten up with envy of him." Contrary to my hopes, the genius seemed
interested in my words, and said he would like to hear the story of the
two neighbours; and as I think, madam, it may please you, I will tell
it to you also.

In a town of moderate size, two men lived in neighbouring houses;
but they had not been there very long before one man took such a
hatred of the other, and envied him so bitterly, that the poor man
determined to find another home, hoping that when they no longer
met every day his enemy would forget all about him.  So he sold
his house and the little furniture it contained, and moved into
the capital of the country, which was luckily at no great distance.
About half a mile from this city he bought a nice little place,
with a large garden and a fair-sized court, in the centre of which
stood an old well.

In order to live a quieter life, the good man put on the robe
of a dervish, and divided his house into a quantity of small cells,
where he soon established a number of other dervishes.
The fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people,
including several of the highest quality, came to visit him and ask
his prayers.

Of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears of
the man who envied him, and this wicked wretch resolved never to rest
till he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he hated.
So he left his house and his business to look after themselves,
and betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where he was
welcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable.  The excuse
he gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult the
chief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance.
"What I have to say must not be overheard," he whispered;
"command, I beg of you, that your dervishes retire into their cells,
as night is approaching, and meet me in the court."

The dervish did as he was asked without delay, and directly they
were alone together the envious man began to tell a long story,
edging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to the well, and when
they were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him in.
He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by anyone,
and congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead,
and would trouble him no more.

But in this he was mistaken!  The old well had long been inhabited
(unknown to mere human beings) by a set of fairies and genii,
who caught the dervish as he fell, so that he received no hurt.
The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for granted that
something strange had happened, or he must certainly have been dashed
against the side of the well and been killed.  He lay quite still,
and in a moment he heard a voice saying, "Can you guess whom this man
is that we have saved from death?"

And the first speaker answered, "I will tell you.  This man,
from pure goodness of heart, forsook the town where he lived and
came to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighbours
of the envy he felt towards him.  But his character soon won him
the esteem of all, and the envious man''s hatred grew, till he
came here with the deliberate intention of causing his death.
And this he would have done, without our help, the very day before
the Sultan has arranged to visit this holy dervish, and to entreat
his prayers for the princess, his daughter."

"But what is the matter with the princess that she needs
the dervish''s prayers?" asked another voice.

"She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of Dimdim,"
replied the first voice.  "But it would be quite simple for this
holy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew!  In his
convent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail.
Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of these
white hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the head
of the princess.  This will deliver her so completely that Maimoum,
the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again."

The fairies and genii ceased talking, but the dervish did not forget
a word of all they had said; and when morning came he perceived
a place in the side of the well which was broken, and where he
could easily climb out.

The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him,
were enchanted at his reappearance.  He told them of the attempt on
his life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired into
his cell.  He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice
had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master.
He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven
white hairs out of his tail, and put them on one side till they
were needed.

The sun had not long risen before the Sultan, who was anxious
to leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess,
arrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery,
and was received by the dervishes with profound respect.
The Sultan lost no time in declaring the object of his visit,
and leading the chief of the dervishes aside, he said to him,
"Noble scheik, you have guessed perhaps what I have come to ask you?"

"Yes, sire," answered the dervish; "if I am not mistaken, it is
the illness of the princess which has procured me this honour."

"You are right," returned the Sultan, "and you will give me fresh
life if you can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the strange
malady that has taken possession of her."

The Sultan, full of hope, sent orders at once that the princess
was to set out as soon as possible, accompanied by her usual staff
of attendants.  When she arrived, she was so thickly veiled that
the dervish could not see her face, but he desired a brazier to be
held over her head, and laid the seven hairs on the burning coals.
The instant they were consumed, terrific cries were heard,
but no one could tell from whom they proceeded.  Only the dervish
guessed that they were uttered by Maimoum the son of Dimdim,
who felt the princess escaping him.

All this time she had seemed unconscious of what she was doing,
but now she raised her hand to her veil and uncovered her face.
"Where am I?" she said in a bewildered manner; "and how did I
get here?"

The Sultan was so delighted to hear these words that he not only
embraced his daughter, but kissed the hand of the dervish.
Then, turning to his attendants who stood round, he said to them,
"What reward shall I give to the man who has restored me my daughter?"

Shortly after these events, the grand-vizir died, and his post
was given to the dervish.  But he did not hold it for long, for the
Sultan fell a victim to an attack of illness, and as he had no sons,
the soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the throne,
to the great joy of all the people.

One day, when the dervish, who had now become Sultan, was making
a royal progress with his court, he perceived the envious man standing
in the crowd.  He made a sign to one of his vizirs, and whispered in
his ear, "Fetch me that man who is standing out there, but take great
care not to frighten him."  The vizir obeyed, and when the envious man
was brought before the Sultan, the monarch said to him, "My friend,
I am delighted to see you again."  Then turning to an officer,
he added, "Give him a thousand pieces of gold out of my treasury,
and twenty waggon-loads of merchandise out of my private stores,
and let an escort of soldiers accompany him home."  He then took
leave of the envious man, and went on his way.

Now when I had ended my story, I proceeded to show the genius
how to apply it to himself.  "O genius," I said, "you see that this
Sultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious man
for the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards and riches upon him."

But the genius had made up his mind, and could not be softened.
"Do not imagine that you are going to escape so easily," he said.
"All I can do is to give you bare life; you will have to learn what
happens to people who interfere with me."

As he spoke he seized me violently by the arm; the roof of the palace
opened to make way for us, and we mounted up so high into the air
that the earth looked like a little cloud.  Then, as before,
he came down with the swiftness of lightning, and we touched
the ground on a mountain top.

Then he stooped and gathered a handful of earth, and murmured some
words over it, after which he threw the earth in my face, saying as
he did so, "Quit the form of a man, and assume that of a monkey."
This done, he vanished, and I was in the likeness of an ape,
and in a country I had never seen before.

However there was no use in stopping where I was, so I came down
the mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was bounded
by the sea.  I travelled towards it, and was pleased to see a
vessel moored about half a mile from shore.  There were no waves,
so I broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to the
water''s edge, sat across it, while, using two sticks for oars,
I rowed myself towards the ship.

The deck was full of people, who watched my progress with interest,
but when I seized a rope and swung myself on board, I found that I
had only escaped death at the hands of the genius to perish
by those of the sailors, lest I should bring ill-luck to the
vessel and the merchants.  "Throw him into the sea!" cried one.
"Knock him on the head with a hammer," exclaimed another.  "Let me
shoot him with an arrow," said a third; and certainly somebody
would have had his way if I had not flung myself at the captain''s
feet and grasped tight hold of his dress.  He appeared touched
by my action and patted my head, and declared that he would take
me under his protection, and that no one should do me any harm.

At the end of about fifty days we cast anchor before a large town,
and the ship was immediately surrounded by a multitude of small
boats filled with people, who had come either to meet their friends
or from simple curiosity.  Among others, one boat contained several
officials, who asked to see the merchants on board, and informed
them that they had been sent by the Sultan in token of welcome,
and to beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of paper.
"In order to explain this strange request," continued the officers,
"it is necessary that you should know that the grand-vizir,
lately dead, was celebrated for his beautiful handwriting,
and the Sultan is anxious to find a similar talent in his successor.
Hitherto the search has been a failure, but his Highness has not yet
given up hope."

One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll,
and when they had all finished, I came forward, and snatched
the paper from the man who held it.  At first they all thought I
was going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when they
saw I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when I
made signs that I too wished to write something.

"Let him do it if he wants to," said the captain.  "If he only makes
a mess of the paper, you may be sure I will punish him for it.
But if, as I hope, he really can write, for he is the cleverest
monkey I ever saw, I will adopt him as my son.  The one I lost had
not nearly so much sense!"

No more was said, and I took the pen and wrote the six sorts
of writing in use among the Arabs, and each sort contained
an original verse or couplet, in praise of the Sultan.  And not
only did my handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants,
but it is hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had ever
before been seen in that country.  When I had ended the officials
took the roll and returned to the Sultan.

As soon as the monarch saw my writing he did not so much as look
at the samples of the merchants, but desired his officials to take
the finest and most richly caparisoned horse in his stables,
together with the most magnificent dress they could procure,
and to put it on the person who had written those lines, and bring
him to court.

The officials began to laugh when they heard the Sultan''s command,
but as soon as they could speak they said, "Deign, your highness,
to excuse our mirth, but those lines were not written by a man
but by a monkey."

Then they put on me the gorgeous robe and rowed me to land, where I
was placed on the horse and led to the palace.  Here the Sultan
was awaiting me in great state surrounded by his court.

All the way along the streets I had been the object of curiosity
to a vast crowd, which had filled every doorway and every window,
and it was amidst their shouts and cheers that I was ushered into
the presence of the Sultan.

I approached the throne on which he was seated and made him three
low bows, then prostrated myself at his feet to the surprise of everyone,
who could not understand how it was possible that a monkey should
be able to distinguish a Sultan from other people, and to pay him
the respect due to his rank.  However, excepting the usual speech,
I omitted none of the common forms attending a royal audience.

When it was over the Sultan dismissed all the court, keeping with him
only the chief of the eunuchs and a little slave.  He then passed
into another room and ordered food to be brought, making signs
to me to sit at table with him and eat.  I rose from my seat,
kissed the ground, and took my place at the table, eating, as you
may suppose, with care and in moderation.

Before the dishes were removed I made signs that writing materials,
which stood in one corner of the room, should be laid in front of me.
I then took a peach and wrote on it some verses in praise of the Sultan,
who was speechless with astonishment; but when I did the same
thing on a glass from which I had drunk he murmured to himself,
"Why, a man who could do as much would be cleverer than any other man,
and this is only a monkey!"

Supper being over chessmen were brought, and the Sultan signed to me
to know if I would play with him.  I kissed the ground and laid my hand
on my head to show that I was ready to show myself worthy of the honour.
He beat me the first game, but I won the second and third, and seeing
that this did not quite please I dashed off a verse by way of consolation.

The Sultan was so enchanted with all the talents of which I had given
proof that he wished me to exhibit some of them to other people.
So turning to the chief of the eunuchs he said, "Go and beg my daughter,
Queen of Beauty, to come here.  I will show her something she has
never seen before."

The chief of the eunuchs bowed and left the room, ushering in a few
moments later the princess, Queen of Beauty.  Her face was uncovered,
but the moment she set foot in the room she threw her veil over
her head.  "Sire," she said to her father, "what can you be thinking
of to summon me like this into the presence of a man?"

"I do not understand you," replied the Sultan.  "There is nobody
here but the eunuch, who is your own servant, the little slave,
and myself, yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach me
for having sent for you, as if I had committed a crime."

"Sire," answered the princess, "I am right and you are wrong.
This monkey is really no monkey at all, but a young prince who has
been turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius, son of
the daughter of Eblis."

As will be imagined, these words took the Sultan by surprise, and he
looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess.
As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head to show that it
was true.

"Sire," replied Queen of Beauty, "the old lady who took care of me
in my childhood was an accomplished magician, and she taught me
seventy rules of her art, by means of which I could, in the twinkling
of an eye, transplant your capital into the middle of the ocean.
Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all persons
who are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was wrought."

"Sire," replied the princess, "there are many out-of-the-way things
it is as well to know, but one should never boast of them."

"Then restore him to his former shape," cried the Sultan.
"You could give me no greater pleasure, for I wish to make him
my grand-vizir, and to give him to you for your husband."

Queen of Beauty rose and went to her chamber, from which she
fetched a knife with some Hebrew words engraven on the blade.
She then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs, the little
slave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace,
and placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herself
standing in the centre of the court.  Here she traced a large
circle and in it wrote several words in Arab characters.

When the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the middle
of it and repeated some verses from the Koran.  Slowly the air
grew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble away,
and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the genius,
son of the daughter of Eblis, suddenly appear under the form of a
colossal lion.

"Dog," cried the princess when she first caught sight of him,
"you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourself
before me in this hideous shape."

"And you," retorted the lion, "have not feared to break our treaty
that engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each other."

"I will teach you how to give me so much trouble," said the lion,
and opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her.  But the
princess expected something of the sort and was on her guard.
She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his mane
repeated two or three words over it.  In an instant it became a sword,
and with a sharp blow she cut the lion''s body into two pieces.
These pieces vanished no one knew where, and only the lion''s
head remained, which was at once changed into a scorpion.
Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpent
and gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was getting
the worst of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight.
But in a moment the serpent had become an eagle more powerful still,
who soared up in the air and after him, and then we lost sight of
them both.

We all remained where we were quaking with anxiety, when the ground
opened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out, its hair
standing on end, and miauing frightfully.  At its heels was a wolf,
who had almost seized it, when the cat changed itself into a worm,
and, piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a tree,
hid itself in the fruit.  The pomegranate swelled till it grew as
large as a pumpkin, and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery,
from which it fell into the court and was broken into bits.
While this was taking place the wolf, who had transformed himself
into a cock, began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate as fast
as he could.  When all were gone he flew towards us, flapping his
wings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly his eye fell
on one which lay on the bank of the little canal that flowed
through the court; he hastened towards it, but before he could touch
it the seed rolled into the canal and became a fish.  The cock
flung himself in after the fish and took the shape of a pike,
and for two hours they chased each other up and down under the water,
uttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing.  At length they
rose from the water in their proper forms, but darting such flames
of fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the palace should
catch fire.  Soon, however, we had much greater cause for alarm,
as the genius, having shaken off the princess, flew towards us.
Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing our danger,
had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself.  As it was,
the Sultan''s beard was singed and his face scorched, the chief
of the eunuchs was burned to a cinder, while a spark deprived me
of the sight of one eye.  Both I and the Sultan had given up all
hope of a rescue, when there was a shout of "Victory, victory!"
from the princess, and the genius lay at her feet a great heap
of ashes.

Exhausted though she was, the princess at once ordered the little slave,
who alone was uninjured, to bring her a cup of water, which she
took in her hand.  First repeating some magic words over it,
she dashed it into my face saying, "If you are only a monkey
by enchantment, resume the form of the man you were before."
In an instant I stood before her the same man I had formerly been,
though having lost the sight of one eye.

I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she did
not give me time.  Turning to the Sultan, her father, she said,
"Sire, I have gained the battle, but it has cost me dear.  The fire
has penetrated to my heart, and I have only a few moments to live.
This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last
pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest.  It was the last
struggle of the genius, and up to that time I was quite safe.
But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire,
and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I
knew more than he did.  He is dead and in ashes, but my own
death is approaching fast."  "My daughter," cried the Sultan,
"how sad is my condition!  I am only surprised I am alive at all!
The eunuch is consumed by the flames, and the prince whom you have
delivered has lost the sight of one eye."  He could say no more,
for sobs choked his voice, and we all wept together.

I have no words, madam, to tell you of my feelings at this
terrible sight.  I would rather have remained a monkey all my
life than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner.
As for the Sultan, he was quite inconsolable, and his subjects,
who had dearly loved the princess, shared his grief.  For seven
days the whole nation mourned, and then the ashes of the princess
were buried with great pomp, and a superb tomb was raised over her.

As soon as the Sultan recovered from the severe illness which
had seized him after the death of the princess he sent for me
and plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence would
always remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantly
quit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it.  I was,
of course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me
I shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender.
After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to come
to Bagdad and request an audience of the Commander of the Faithful.

My story, said the Third Calender, is quite different from those of my
two friends.  It was fate that deprived them of the sight of their
right eyes, but mine was lost by my own folly.

My name is Agib, and I am the son of a king called Cassib, who reigned
over a large kingdom, which had for its capital one of the finest
seaport towns in the world.

When I succeeded to my father''s throne my first care was to visit the
provinces on the mainland, and then to sail to the numerous islands
which lay off the shore, in order to gain the hearts of my subjects.
These voyages gave me such a taste for sailing that I soon determined
to explore more distant seas, and commanded a fleet of large ships to
be got ready without delay.  When they were properly fitted out I
embarked on my expedition.

For forty days wind and weather were all in our favour, but the next
night a terrific storm arose, which blew us hither and thither for ten
days, till the pilot confessed that he had quite lost his bearings.
Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to try to catch a
sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seen but the sea and
sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern.

On hearing this the pilot grew white, and, beating his breast, he
cried, "Oh, sir, we are lost, lost!" till the ship''s crew trembled at
they knew not what.  When he had recovered himself a little, and was
able to explain the cause of his terror, he replied, in answer to my
question, that we had drifted far out of our course, and that the
following day about noon we should come near that mass of darkness,
which, said he, is nothing but the famous Black Mountain.  This
mountain is composed of adamant, which attracts to itself all the iron
and nails in your ship; and as we are helplessly drawn nearer, the
force of attraction will become so great that the iron and nails will
fall out of the ships and cling to the mountain, and the ships will
sink to the bottom with all that are in them.  This it is that causes
the side of the mountain towards the sea to appear of such a dense
blackness.

As may be supposed--continued the pilot--the mountain sides are very
rugged, but on the summit stands a brass dome supported on pillars, and
bearing on top the figure of a brass horse, with a rider on his back.
This rider wears a breastplate of lead, on which strange signs and
figures are engraved, and it is said that as long as this statue
remains on the dome, vessels will never cease to perish at the foot of
the mountain.

So saying, the pilot began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing their
last hour had come, made their wills, each one in favour of his fellow.

At noon next day, as the pilot had foretold, we were so near to the
Black Mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of the ships
and dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible noise.  A
moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the crews with them.  I
alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was driven ashore by the
wind, without even a scratch.  What was my joy on finding myself at the
bottom of some steps which led straight up the mountain, for there was
not another inch to the right or the left where a man could set his
foot.  And, indeed, even the steps themselves were so narrow and so
steep that, if the lightest breeze had arisen, I should certainly have
been blown into the sea.

When I reached the top I found the brass dome and the statue exactly as
the pilot had described, but was too wearied with all I had gone
through to do more than glance at them, and, flinging myself under the
dome, was asleep in an instant.  In my dreams an old man appeared to me
and said, "Hearken, Agib!  As soon as thou art awake dig up the ground
underfoot, and thou shalt find a bow of brass and three arrows of lead.
Shoot the arrows at the statue, and the rider shall tumble into the
sea, but the horse will fall down by thy side, and thou shalt bury him
in the place from which thou tookest the bow and arrows.  This being
done the sea will rise and cover the mountain, and on it thou wilt
perceive the figure of a metal man seated in a boat, having an oar in
each hand.  Step on board and let him conduct thee; but if thou
wouldest behold thy kingdom again, see that thou takest not the name of
Allah into thy mouth."

Having uttered these words the vision left me, and I woke, much
comforted.  I sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out of the ground,
and with the third shot the horseman fell with a great crash into the
sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that I had hardly time
to bury the horse before the boat approached me.  I stepped silently in
and sat down, and the metal man pushed off, and rowed without stopping
for nine days, after which land appeared on the horizon.  I was so
overcome with joy at this sight that I forgot all the old man had told
me, and cried out, "Allah be praised!  Allah be praised!"

The words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man sank from
beneath me, and left me floating on the surface.  All that day and the
next night I swam and floated alternately, making as well as I could
for the land which was nearest to me.  At last my strength began to
fail, and I gave myself up for lost, when the wind suddenly rose, and a
huge wave cast me on a flat shore.  Then, placing myself in safety, I
hastily spread my clothes out to dry in the sun, and flung myself on
the warm ground to rest.

Next morning I dressed myself and began to look about me.  There seemed
to be no one but myself on the island, which was covered with fruit
trees and watered with streams, but seemed a long distance from the
mainland which I hoped to reach.  Before, however, I had time to feel
cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the island, and not knowing
whether it would contain friends or foes, I hid myself in the thick
branches of a tree.

The sailors ran the ship into a creek, where ten slaves landed,
carrying spades and pickaxes.  In the middle of the island they
stopped, and after digging some time, lifted up what seemed to be a
trapdoor.  They then returned to the vessel two or three times for
furniture and provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old man,
leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age.  They all
disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining below for a few
minutes came up again, but without the boy, and let down the trapdoor,
covering it with earth as before.  This done, they entered the ship and
set sail.

As soon as they were out of sight, I came down from my tree, and went
to the place where the boy had been buried.  I dug up the earth till I
reached a large stone with a ring in the centre.  This, when removed,
disclosed a flight of stone steps which led to a large room richly
furnished and lighted by tapers.  On a pile of cushions, covered with
tapestry, sat the boy.  He looked up, startled and frightened at the
sight of a stranger in such a place, and to soothe his fears, I at once
spoke:  "Be not alarmed, sir, whoever you may be.  I am a king, and the
son of a king, and will do you no hurt.  On the contrary, perhaps I
have been sent here to deliver you out of this tomb, where you have
been buried alive."

Hearing my words, the young man recovered himself, and when I had
ended, he said, "The reasons, Prince, that have caused me to be buried
in this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise you.  My
father is a rich merchant, owning much land and many ships, and has
great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceased mourning that he
had no child to inherit his wealth.

"At length one day he dreamed that the following year a son would be
born to him, and when this actually happened, he consulted all the wise
men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant.  One and all they
said the same thing.  I was to live happily till I was fifteen, when a
terrible danger awaited me, which I should hardly escape.  If, however,
I should succeed in doing so, I should live to a great old age.  And,
they added, when the statue of the brass horse on the top of the
mountain of adamant is thrown into the sea by Agib, the son of Cassib,
then beware, for fifty days later your son shall fall by his hand!

"This prophecy struck the heart of my father with such woe, that he
never got over it, but that did not prevent him from attending
carefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago, my
fifteenth birthday.  It was only yesterday that the news reached him
that ten days previously the statue of brass had been thrown into the
sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this underground chamber,
which was built for the purpose, promising to fetch me out when the
forty days have passed.  For myself, I have no fears, as Prince Agib is
not likely to come here to look for me."

I listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of my
ever wishing to cause the death of this harmless boy, whom I hastened
to assure of my friendship and even of my protection; begging him, in
return, to convey me in his father''s ship to my own country.  I need
hardly say that I took special care not to inform him that I was the
Agib whom he dreaded.

The day passed in conversation on various subjects, and I found him a
youth of ready wit and of some learning.  I took on myself the duties
of a servant, held the basin and water for him when he washed, prepared
the dinner and set it on the table.  He soon grew to love me, and for
thirty-nine days we spent as pleasant an existence as could be expected
underground.

The morning of the fortieth dawned, and the young man when he woke gave
thanks in an outburst of joy that the danger was passed.  "My father
may be here at any moment," said he, "so make me, I pray you, a bath of
hot water, that I may bathe, and change my clothes, and be ready to
receive him."

So I fetched the water as he asked, and washed and rubbed him, after
which he lay down again and slept a little.  When he opened his eyes
for the second time, he begged me to bring him a melon and some sugar,
that he might eat and refresh himself.

I soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained, but could find
no knife to cut it with.  "Look in the cornice over my head," said he,
"and I think you will see one."  It was so high above me, that I had
some difficulty in reaching it, and catching my foot in the covering of
the bed, I slipped, and fell right upon the young man, the knife going
straight into his heart.

At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain.  I threw
myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow.
Then, fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father, I
raised the great stone which blocked the staircase, and quitting the
underground chamber, made everything fast as before.

Scarcely had I finished when, looking out to sea, I saw the vessel
heading for the island, and, feeling that it would be useless for me to
protest my innocence, I again concealed myself among the branches of a
tree that grew near by.

The old man and his slaves pushed off in a boat directly the ship
touched land, and walked quickly towards the entrance to the
underground chamber; but when they were near enough to see that the
earth had been disturbed, they paused and changed colour.  In silence
they all went down and called to the youth by name; then for a moment I
heard no more.  Suddenly a fearful scream rent the air, and the next
instant the slaves came up the steps, carrying with them the body of
the old man, who had fainted from sorrow!  Laying him down at the foot
of the tree in which I had taken shelter, they did their best to
recover him, but it took a long while.  When at last he revived, they
left him to dig a grave, and then laying the young man''s body in it,
they threw in the earth.

This ended, the slaves brought up all the furniture that remained
below, and put it on the vessel, and breaking some boughs to weave a
litter, they laid the old man on it, and carried him to the ship, which
spread its sails and stood out to sea.

So once more I was quite alone, and for a whole month I walked daily
over the island, seeking for some chance of escape.  At length one day
it struck me that my prison had grown much larger, and that the
mainland seemed to be nearer.  My heart beat at this thought, which was
almost too good to be true.  I watched a little longer: there was no
doubt about it, and soon there was only a tiny stream for me to cross.

Even when I was safe on the other side I had a long distance to go on
the mud and sand before I reached dry ground, and very tired I was,
when far in front of me I caught sight of a castle of red copper,
which, at first sight, I took to be a fire.  I made all the haste I
could, and after some miles of hard walking stood before it, and gazed
at it in astonishment, for it seemed to me the most wonderful building
I had ever beheld.  While I was still staring at it, there came towards
me a tall old man, accompanied by ten young men, all handsome, and all
blind of the right eye.

Now in its way, the spectacle of ten men walking together, all blind of
the right eye, is as uncommon as that of a copper castle, and I was
turning over in my mind what could be the meaning of this strange fact,
when they greeted me warmly, and inquired what had brought me there.  I
replied that my story was somewhat long, but that if they would take
the trouble to sit down, I should be happy to tell it them.  When I had
finished, the young men begged that I would go with them to the castle,
and I joyfully accepted their offer.  We passed through what seemed to
me an endless number of rooms, and came at length into a large hall,
furnished with ten small blue sofas for the ten young men, which served
as beds as well as chairs, and with another sofa in the middle for the
old man.  As none of the sofas could hold more than one person, they
bade me place myself on the carpet, and to ask no questions about
anything I should see.

After a little while the old man rose and brought in supper, which I
ate heartily, for I was very hungry.  Then one of the young men begged
me to repeat my story, which had struck them all with astonishment, and
when I had ended, the old man was bidden to "do his duty," as it was
late, and they wished to go to bed.  At these words he rose, and went
to a closet, from which he brought out ten basins, all covered with
blue stuff.  He set one before each of the young men, together with a
lighted taper.

When the covers were taken off the basins, I saw they were filled with
ashes, coal-dust, and lamp-black. The young men mixed these all
together, and smeared the whole over their heads and faces.  They then
wept and beat their breasts, crying, "This is the fruit of idleness,
and of our wicked lives."

This ceremony lasted nearly the whole night, and when it stopped they
washed themselves carefully, and put on fresh clothes, and lay down to
sleep.

All this while I had refrained from questions, though my curiosity
almost seemed to burn a hole in me, but the following day, when we went
out to walk, I said to them, "Gentlemen, I must disobey your wishes,
for I can keep silence no more.  You do not appear to lack wit, yet you
do such actions as none but madmen could be capable of.  Whatever
befalls me I cannot forbear asking, `Why you daub your faces with
black, and how it is you are all blind of one eye?''" But they only
answered that such questions were none of my business, and that I
should do well to hold my peace.

During that day we spoke of other things, but when night came, and the
same ceremony was repeated, I implored them most earnestly to let me
know the meaning of it all.

"It is for your own sake," replied one of the young men, "that we have
not granted your request, and to preserve you from our unfortunate
fate.  If, however, you wish to share our destiny we will delay no
longer."

I answered that whatever might be the consequence I wished to have my
curiosity satisfied, and that I would take the result on my own head.
He then assured me that, even when I had lost my eye, I should be
unable to remain with them, as their number was complete, and could not
be added to.  But to this I replied that, though I should be grieved to
part company with such honest gentlemen, I would not be turned from my
resolution on that account.

On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed
it, and handed me a knife, which they said I should by-and-by find
useful.  "We must sew you into this sheep-skin," said they, "and then
leave you.  A fowl of monstrous size, called a roc, will appear in the
air, taking you to be a sheep.  He will snatch you up and carry you
into the sky, but be not alarmed, for he will bring you safely down and
lay you on the top of a mountain.  When you are on the ground cut the
skin with the knife and throw it off.  As soon as the roc sees you he
will fly away from fear, but you must walk on till you come to a castle
covered with plates of gold, studded with jewels.  Enter boldly at the
gate, which always stands open, but do not ask us to tell you what we
saw or what befel us there, for that you will learn for yourself.  This
only we may say, that it cost us each our right eye, and has imposed
upon us our nightly penance."

After the young gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewing the
sheep-skin on me they left me, and retired to the hall.  In a few
minutes the roc appeared, and bore me off to the top of the mountain in
his huge claws as lightly as if I had been a feather, for this great
white bird is so strong that he has been known to carry even an
elephant to his nest in the hills.

The moment my feet touched the ground I took out my knife and cut the
threads that bound me, and the sight of me in my proper clothes so
alarmed the roc that he spread his wings and flew away.  Then I set out
to seek the castle.

I found it after wandering about for half a day, and never could I have
imagined anything so glorious.  The gate led into a square court, into
which opened a hundred doors, ninety-nine of them being of rare woods
and one of gold.  Through each of these doors I caught glimpses of
splendid gardens or of rich storehouses.

Entering one of the doors which was standing open I found myself in a
vast hall where forty young ladies, magnificently dressed, and of
perfect beauty, were reclining.  As soon as they saw me they rose and
uttered words of welcome, and even forced me to take possession of a
seat that was higher than their own, though my proper place was at
their feet.  Not content with this, one brought me splendid garments,
while another filled a basin with scented water and poured it over my
hands, and the rest busied themselves with preparing refreshments.
After I had eaten and drunk of the most delicate food and rarest wines,
the ladies crowded round me and begged me to tell them all my
adventures.

By the time I had finished night had fallen, and the ladies lighted up
the castle with such a prodigious quantity of tapers that even day
could hardly have been brighter.  We then sat down to a supper of dried
fruits and sweetmeats, after which some sang and others danced.  I was
so well amused that I did not notice how the time was passing, but at
length one of the ladies approached and informed me it was midnight,
and that, as I must be tired, she would conduct me to the room that had
been prepared for me.  Then, bidding me good-night, I was left to sleep.

I spent the next thirty-nine days in much the same way as the first,
but at the close of that time the ladies appeared (as was their custom)
in my room one morning to inquire how I had slept, and instead of
looking cheerful and smiling they were in floods of tears.  "Prince,"
said they, "we must leave you, and never was it so hard to part from
any of our friends.  Most likely we shall never see you again, but if
you have sufficient self-command perhaps we may yet look forward to a
meeting."

"Know then," answered one of them, "that we are all princesses--each a
king''s daughter.  We live in this castle together, in the way that you
have seen, but at the end of every year secret duties call us away for
the space of forty days.  The time has now come; but before we depart,
we will leave you our keys, so that you may not lack entertainment
during our absence.  But one thing we would ask of you.  The Golden
Door, alone, forbear to open, as you value your own peace, and the
happiness of your life.  That door once unlocked, we must bid you
farewell for ever."

Every day I opened two or three fresh doors, each of which contained
behind it so many curious things that I had no chance of feeling dull,
much as I regretted the absence of the ladies.  Sometimes it was an
orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bigness any that grew in my
father''s garden.  Sometimes it was a court planted with roses,
jessamine, dafeodils, hyacinths and anemones, and a thousand other
flowers of which I did not know the names.  Or again, it would be an
aviary, fitted with all kinds of singing birds, or a treasury heaped up
with precious stones; but whatever I might see, all was perfect of its
own sort.

Thirty-nine days passed away more rapidly than I could have conceived
possible, and the following morning the princesses were to return to
the castle.  But alas!  I had explored every corner, save only the room
that was shut in by the Golden Door, and I had no longer anything to
amuse myself with.  I stood before the forbidden place for some time,
gazing at its beauty; then a happy inspiration struck me, that because
I unlocked the door it was not necessary that I should enter the
chamber.  It would be enough for me to stand outside and view whatever
hidden wonders might be therein.

Thus arguing against my own conscience, I turned the key, when a smell
rushed out that, pleasant though it was, overcame me completely, and I
fell fainting across the threshold.  Instead of being warned by this
accident, directly I came to myself I went for a few moments into the
air to shake of the effects of the perfume, and then entered boldly.  I
found myself in a large, vaulted room, lighted by tapers, scented with
aloes and ambergris, standing in golden candle-sticks, whilst gold and
silver lamps hung from the ceiling.

Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid them
scant attention, so much was I struck by a great black horse which
stood in one corner, the handsomest and best-shaped animal I had ever
seen.  His saddle and bridle were of massive gold, curiously wrought;
one side of his trough was filled with clean barley and sesame, and the
other with rose water.  I led the animal into the open air, and then
jumped on his back, shaking the reins as I did so, but as he never
stirred, I touched him lightly with a switch I had picked up in his
stable.  No sooner did he feel the stroke, than he spread his wings
(which I had not perceived before), and flew up with me straight into
the sky.  When he had reached a prodigious height, he next darted back
to earth, and alighted on the terrace belonging to a castle, shaking me
violently out of the saddle as he did so, and giving me such a blow
with his tail, that he knocked out my right eye.

Half-stunned as I was with all that had happened to me, I rose to my
feet, thinking as I did so of what had befallen the ten young men, and
watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds.  I left the
terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall, which I knew to have
been the one from which the roc had taken me, by the ten blue sofas
against the wall.

The ten young men were not present when I first entered, but came in
soon after, accompanied by the old man.  They greeted me kindly, and
bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed, they had expected nothing less.
"All that has happened to you," they said, "we also have undergone, and
we should be enjoying the same happiness still, had we not opened the
Golden Door while the princesses were absent.  You have been no wiser
than we, and have suffered the same punishment.  We would gladly
receive you among us, to perform such penance as we do, but we have
already told you that this is impossible.  Depart, therefore, from
hence and go to the Court of Bagdad, where you shall meet with him that
can decide your destiny." They told me the way I was to travel, and I
left them.

On the road I caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and put on a
Calender''s habit.  I have had a long journey, but arrived this evening
in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate, being
strangers like myself.  We wondered much at one another, to see we were
all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure to discourse at length
of our common calamities.  We had only so much time as to come hither
to implore those favours which you have been generously pleased to
grant us.

He finished, and it was Zobeida''s turn to speak:  "Go wherever you
please," she said, addressing all three.  "I pardon you all, but you
must depart immediately out of this house."

In the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad a
poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sent to carry a
heavy load from one end of the city to the other.  Before he had
accomplished half the distance he was so tired that, finding himself in
a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water, and a
cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and sat
down to rest in the shade of a grand house.  Very soon he decided that
he could not have chosen a pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of
aloes wood and pastilles came from the open windows and mingled with
the scent of the rose water which steamed up from the hot pavement.
Within the palace he heard some music, as of many instruments cunningly
played, and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds, and
by this, and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he
presently became aware, he judged that feasting and merry making were
going on.  He wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had
never seen before, the street in which it stood being one which he
seldom had occasion to pass.  To satisfy his curiosity he went up to
some splendidly dressed servants who stood at the door, and asked one
of them the name of the master of the mansion.

"What," replied he, "do you live in Bagdad, and not know that here
lives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailed
over every sea upon which the sun shines?"

The porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense wealth of
Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemed to be
as happy as his own was miserable.  Casting his eyes up to the sky he
exclaimed aloud,

"Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences between
Sindbad''s life and mine.  Every day I suffer a thousand hardships and
misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to
keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad spends money
right and left and lives upon the fat of the land!  What has he done
that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to
deserve so hard a fate?"

So saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with
misery and despair.  Just at this moment a servant came out of the
palace, and taking him by the arm said, "Come with me, the noble
Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you."

Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that his
unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad,
so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave
the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street.  However the
lackey promised him that it should be taken care of, and urged him to
obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to
yield.

He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company was
seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies.  In the
place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard gave him a
venerable air.  Behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to
minister to his wants.  This was the famous Sindbad himself.  The
porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence,
tremblingly saluted the noble company.  Sindbad, making a sign to him
to approach, caused him to be seated at his right hand, and himself
heaped choice morsels upon his plate, and poured out for him a draught
of excellent wine, and presently, when the banquet drew to a close,
spoke to him familiarly, asking his name and occupation.

"I am glad to see you here," continued Sindbad.  "And I will answer for
the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you
to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street." For
Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began, had heard
his complaint and therefore had sent for him.

At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging down
his head, replied, "My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness and
ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me."

"Oh!" replied Sindbad, "do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blame
you.  On the contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you.
Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right.
You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxury
that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far
indeed from being the case.  I have only reached this happy state after
having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger.

"Yes, my noble friends," he continued, addressing the company, "I
assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even
the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas.
Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven
voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and
land, I will now give you a full and true account of them, which I
think you will be well pleased to hear."

As Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account of the
porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burden which
had been left in the street should be carried by some of his own
servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first, while he
remained to listen to the story.

I had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being young
and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every kind of
pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take to
themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine, and
remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed, I began to
bethink me of how I could make the best of what still remained to me.
I sold all my household goods by public auction, and joined a company
of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with them at Balsora in a
ship which we had fitted out between us.

We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by the Persian
Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and upon our right
the shores of Arabia Felix.  I was at first much troubled by the uneasy
motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health, and since that
hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness.

From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or
exchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly,
we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green
meadow, which only rose slightly above the surface of the water.  Our
sails were furled, and the captain gave permission to all who wished to
land for a while and amuse themselves.  I was among the number, but
when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down
to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us, we were startled by a
sudden and violent trembling of the island, while at the same moment
those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for
our lives, since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the
back of a sleeping whale.  Those who were nearest to the boat threw
themselves into it, others sprang into the sea, but before I could save
myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving
me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our
fire.  Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that
ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those
who were in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I
was left at the mercy of the waves.  All that day I floated up and
down, now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired
for my life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail
support, and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I
had drifted against an island.

The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some tree-roots
protruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at last, and
stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay, more dead than
alive, till the sun was high in the heavens.  By that time I was very
hungry, but after some searching I came upon some eatable herbs, and a
spring of clear water, and much refreshed I set out to explore the
island.  Presently I reached a great plain where a grazing horse was
tethered, and as I stood looking at it I heard voices talking
apparently underground, and in a moment a man appeared who asked me how
I came upon the island.  I told him my adventures, and heard in return
that he was one of the grooms of Mihrage, the king of the island, and
that each year they came to feed their master''s horses in this plain.
He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and when I
had eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myself
fortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were going back
to their master on the morrow, and without their aid I could certainly
never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island.

Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we reached the
capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom I related my
adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be well cared for and
provided with such things as I needed.  Being a merchant I sought out
men of my own profession, and particularly those who came from foreign
countries, as I hoped in this way to hear news from Bagdad, and find
out some means of returning thither, for the capital was situated upon
the sea-shore, and visited by vessels from all parts of the world.  In
the meantime I heard many curious things, and answered many questions
concerning my own country, for I talked willingly with all who came to
me.  Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island
named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to
be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial.  Indeed, the sailors assured me
that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it.
However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage, saving some fish that
were full two hundred cubits long, but were fortunately more in dread
of us than even we were of them, and fled from us if we did but strike
upon a board to frighten them.  Other fishes there were only a cubit
long which had heads like owls.

One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a ship which
had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo, while the
merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing the removal of it
to their warehouses.  Drawing nearer I presently noticed that my own
name was marked upon some of the packages, and after having carefully
examined them, I felt sure that they were indeed those which I had put
on board our ship at Balsora.  I then recognised the captain of the
vessel, but as I was certain that he believed me to be dead, I went up
to him and asked who owned the packages that I was looking at.

"There was on board my ship," he replied, "a merchant of Bagdad named
Sindbad.  One day he and several of my other passengers landed upon
what we supposed to be an island, but which was really an enormous
whale floating asleep upon the waves.  No sooner did it feel upon its
back the heat of the fire which had been kindled, than it plunged into
the depths of the sea.  Several of the people who were upon it perished
in the waters, and among others this unlucky Sindbad.  This merchandise
is his, but I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his
family if I should ever chance to meet with them."

When the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement,
"Lackaday! and what is the world coming to?  In these days there is not
an honest man to be met with.  Did I not with my own eyes see Sindbad
drown, and now you have the audacity to tell me that you are he!  I
should have taken you to be a just man, and yet for the sake of
obtaining that which does not belong to you, you are ready to invent
this horrible falsehood."

So I told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the king''s
grooms, and how kindly I had been received at the palace.  Very soon I
began to see that I had made some impression upon him, and after the
arrival of some of the other merchants, who showed great joy at once
more seeing me alive, he declared that he also recognised me.

Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, "Heaven be praised that you
have escaped from so great a danger.  As to your goods, I pray you take
them, and dispose of them as you please." I thanked him, and praised
his honesty, begging him to accept several bales of merchandise in
token of my gratitude, but he would take nothing.  Of the choicest of
my goods I prepared a present for King Mihrage, who was at first
amazed, having known that I had lost my all.  However, when I had
explained to him how my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he
graciously accepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable
things.  I then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for
sandal and aloes wood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I
embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully upon our
homeward voyage that I arrived in Balsora with about one hundred
thousand sequins.  My family received me with as much joy as I felt
upon seeing them once more.  I bought land and slaves, and built a
great house in which I resolved to live happily, and in the enjoyment
of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings.

Here Sindbad paused, and commanded the musicians to play again, while
the feasting continued until evening.  When the time came for the
porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse containing one hundred
sequins, saying, "Take this, Hindbad, and go home, but to-morrow come
again and you shall hear more of my adventures."

The porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity, and you may
imagine that he was well received at home, where his wife and children
thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a benefactor.

The next day Hindbad, dressed in his best, returned to the voyager''s
house, and was received with open arms.  As soon as all the guests had
arrived the banquet began as before, and when they had feasted long and
merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus:

"My friends, I beg that you will give me your attention while I relate
the adventures of my second voyage, which you will find even more
astonishing than the first."

I had resolved, as you know, on my return from my first voyage, to
spend the rest of my days quietly in Bagdad, but very soon I grew tired
of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself upon the sea.

I procured, therefore, such goods as were suitable for the places I
intended to visit, and embarked for the second time in a good ship with
other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men.  We went from island
to island, often making excellent bargains, until one day we landed at
a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and abounding in springs
of excellent water, appeared to possess neither houses nor people.
While my companions wandered here and there gathering flowers and fruit
I sat down in a shady place, and, having heartily enjoyed the
provisions and the wine I had brought with me, I fell asleep, lulled by
the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by.

How long I slept I know not, but when I opened my eyes and started to
my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was
gone.  I rushed to and fro like one distracted, uttering cries of
despair, and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just
disappearing upon the horizon, I wished bitterly enough that I had been
content to stay at home in safety.  But since wishes could do me no
good, I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of
escape.  When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my
anxious glances towards the sea; but, finding nothing hopeful there, I
turned landward, and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white
object, so far off that I could not make out what it might be.

Descending from the tree I hastily collected what remained of my
provisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it.  As I drew
near it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height, and
when I could touch it, I found it marvellously smooth and soft.  As it
was impossible to climb it--for it presented no foot-hold--I walked
round about it seeking some opening, but there was none.  I counted,
however, that it was at least fifty paces round.  By this time the sun
was near setting, but quite suddenly it fell dark, something like a
huge black cloud came swiftly over me, and I saw with amazement that it
was a bird of extraordinary size which was hovering near.  Then I
remembered that I had often heard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird
called a roc, and it occurred to me that the white object which had so
puzzled me must be its egg.

Sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it, covering it with its
wings to keep it warm, and I cowered close beside the egg in such a
position that one of the bird''s feet, which was as large as the trunk
of a tree, was just in front of me.  Taking off my turban I bound
myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc, when it
took flight next morning, would bear me away with it from the desolate
island.  And this was precisely what did happen.  As soon as the dawn
appeared the bird rose into the air carrying me up and up till I could
no longer see the earth, and then suddenly it descended so swiftly that
I almost lost consciousness.  When I became aware that the roc had
settled and that I was once again upon solid ground, I hastily unbound
my turban from its foot and freed myself, and that not a moment too
soon; for the bird, pouncing upon a huge snake, killed it with a few
blows from its powerful beak, and seizing it up rose into the air once
more and soon disappeared from my view.  When I had looked about me I
began to doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the desolate island.

The valley in which I found myself was deep and narrow, and surrounded
by mountains which towered into the clouds, and were so steep and rocky
that there was no way of climbing up their sides.  As I wandered about,
seeking anxiously for some means of escaping from this trap, I observed
that the ground was strewed with diamonds, some of them of an
astonishing size.  This sight gave me great pleasure, but my delight
was speedily damped when I saw also numbers of horrible snakes so long
and so large that the smallest of them could have swallowed an elephant
with ease.  Fortunately for me they seemed to hide in caverns of the
rocks by day, and only came out by night, probably because of their
enemy the roc.

All day long I wandered up and down the valley, and when it grew dusk I
crept into a little cave, and having blocked up the entrance to it with
a stone, I ate part of my little store of food and lay down to sleep,
but all through the night the serpents crawled to and fro, hissing
horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes for terror.  I was
thankful when the morning light appeared, and when I judged by the
silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens I came
tremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and down the valley once
more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for I felt
that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation.  At last,
overcome with weariness, I sat down upon a rock, but I had hardly
closed my eyes when I was startled by something which fell to the
ground with a thud close beside me.

It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it several more
pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places.  I had always
thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous valley of
diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had devised for
getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers'' tales invented to
give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceived that they were surely
true.  These merchants came to the valley at the time when the eagles,
which keep their eyries in the rocks, had hatched their young.  The
merchants then threw great lumps of meat into the valley.  These,
falling with so much force upon the diamonds, were sure to take up some
of the precious stones with them, when the eagles pounced upon the meat
and carried it off to their nests to feed their hungry broods.  Then
the merchants, scaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries,
would secure their treasures.  Until this moment I had looked upon the
valley as my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting out of it
alive, but now I took courage and began to devise a means of escape.  I
began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find and storing
them carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions;
this I tied securely to my belt.  I then chose the piece of meat which
seemed most suited to my purpose, and with the aid of my turban bound
it firmly to my back; this done I laid down upon my face and awaited
the coming of the eagles.  I soon heard the flapping of their mighty
wings above me, and had the satisfaction of feeling one of them seize
upon my piece of meat, and me with it, and rise slowly towards his
nest, into which he presently dropped me.  Luckily for me the merchants
were on the watch, and setting up their usual outcries they rushed to
the nest scaring away the eagle.  Their amazement was great when they
discovered me, and also their disappointment, and with one accord they
fell to abusing me for having robbed them of their usual profit.
Addressing myself to the one who seemed most aggrieved, I said:  "I am
sure, if you knew all that I have suffered, you would show more
kindness towards me, and as for diamonds, I have enough here of the
very best for you and me and all your company."  So saying I showed
them to him.  The others all crowded round me, wondering at my
adventures and admiring the device by which I had escaped from the
valley, and when they had led me to their camp and examined my
diamonds, they assured me that in all the years that they had carried
on their trade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for
size and beauty.

I found that each merchant chose a particular nest, and took his chance
of what he might find in it.  So I begged the one who owned the nest to
which I had been carried to take as much as he would of my treasure,
but he contented himself with one stone, and that by no means the
largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortune was made, and he
need toil no more.  I stayed with the merchants several days, and then
as they were journeying homewards I gladly accompanied them.  Our way
lay across high mountains infested with frightful serpents, but we had
the good luck to escape them and came at last to the seashore.  Thence
we sailed to the isle of Rohat where the camphor trees grow to such a
size that a hundred men could shelter under one of them with ease.  The
sap flows from an incision made high up in the tree into a vessel hung
there to receive it, and soon hardens into the substance called
camphor, but the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so
treated.

In this same island we saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is smaller
than the elephant and larger than the buffalo.  It has one horn about a
cubit long which is solid, but has a furrow from the base to the tip.
Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man.  The rhinoceros
fights with the elephant, and transfixing him with his horn carries him
off upon his head, but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy, he
falls helpless to the ground, and then comes the roc, and clutches them
both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young.  This doubtless
astonishes you, but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see
for yourself.  For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many
other wonderful things which we saw in this island.  Before we left I
exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I
profited greatly on our homeward way.  At last we reached Balsora,
whence I hastened to Bagdad, where my first action was to bestow large
sums of money upon the poor, after which I settled down to enjoy
tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain.

Having thus related the adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad again
bestowed a hundred sequins upon Hindbad, inviting him to come again on
the following day and hear how he fared upon his third voyage.  The
other guests also departed to their homes, but all returned at the same
hour next day, including the porter, whose former life of hard work and
poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream.  Again after
the feast was over did Sindbad claim the attention of his guests and
began the account of his third voyage.

After a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me quite
forget the perils of my two voyages.  Moreover, as I was still in the
prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing.  So once more
providing myself with the rarest and choicest merchandise of Bagdad, I
conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail with other merchants of my
acquaintance for distant lands.  We had touched at many ports and made
much profit, when one day upon the open sea we were caught by a
terrible wind which blew us completely out of our reckoning, and
lasting for several days finally drove us into harbour on a strange
island.

"I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here," quoth our
captain.  "This island and all adjoining it are inhabited by hairy
savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these dwarfs may do
we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts, and if one of them
is killed the rest will fall upon us, and speedily make an end of us."

These words caused great consternation among all the ship''s company,
and only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly.
There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages, not more than two
feet high and covered with reddish fur.  Throwing themselves into the
waves they surrounded our vessel.  Chattering meanwhile in a language
we could not understand, and clutching at ropes and gangways, they
swarmed up the ship''s side with such speed and agility that they almost
seemed to fly.

You may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched them,
neither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to deter them
from their purpose, whatever it might be.  Of this we were not left
long in doubt.  Hoisting the sails, and cutting the cable of the
anchor, they sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further
off, where they drove us ashore; then taking possession of her, they
made off to the place from which they had come, leaving us helpless
upon a shore avoided with horror by all mariners for a reason which you
will soon learn.

Turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland, finding as we
went various herbs and fruits which we ate, feeling that we might as
well live as long as possible though we had no hope of escape.
Presently we saw in the far distance what seemed to us to be a splendid
palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but when we reached it
we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly built.  Pushing back
the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard, but upon the threshold
of the great hall beyond it we paused, frozen with horror, at the sight
which greeted us.  On one side lay a huge pile of bones--human bones,
and on the other numberless spits for roasting!  Overcome with despair
we sank trembling to the ground, and lay there without speech or
motion.  The sun was setting when a loud noise aroused us, the door of
the hall was violently burst open and a horrible giant entered.  He was
as tall as a palm tree, and perfectly black, and had one eye, which
flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead.  His teeth
were long and sharp and grinned horribly, while his lower lip hung down
upon his chest, and he had ears like elephant''s ears, which covered his
shoulders, and nails like the claws of some fierce bird.

At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men.
When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us
attentively with his fearful eye.  Presently when he had looked at us
enough he came towards us, and stretching out his hand took me by the
back of the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I was
mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next, whom
he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain, and
finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up in one hand and stuck
him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fire at which he
presently roasted him.  After the giant had supped he lay down to
sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while we lay shivering with
horror the whole night through, and when day broke he awoke and went
out, leaving us in the castle.

When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning our
horrible fate, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries.  Though
we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us to kill
him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even if we had
thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves.  So at
last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wandering up and
down the island eating such fruits as we could find, and when night
came we returned to the castle, having sought in vain for any other
place of shelter.  At sunset the giant returned, supped upon one of our
unhappy comrades, slept and snored till dawn, and then left us as
before.  Our condition seemed to us so frightful that several of my
companions thought it would be better to leap from the cliffs and
perish in the waves at once, rather than await so miserable an end; but
I had a plan of escape which I now unfolded to them, and which they at
once agreed to attempt.

"Listen, my brothers," I added.  "You know that plenty of driftwood
lies along the shore.  Let us make several rafts, and carry them to a
suitable place.  If our plot succeeds, we can wait patiently for the
chance of some passing ship which would rescue us from this fatal
island.  If it fails, we must quickly take to our rafts; frail as they
are, we have more chance of saving our lives with them than we have if
we remain here."

All agreed with me, and we spent the day in building rafts, each
capable of carrying three persons.  At nightfall we returned to the
castle, and very soon in came the giant, and one more of our number was
sacrificed.  But the time of our vengeance was at hand!  As soon as he
had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleep as before, and
when we heard him begin to snore I, and nine of the boldest of my
comrades, rose softly, and took each a spit, which we made red-hot in
the fire, and then at a given signal we plunged it with one accord into
the giant''s eye, completely blinding him.  Uttering a terrible cry, he
sprang to his feet clutching in all directions to try to seize one of
us, but we had all fled different ways as soon as the deed was done,
and thrown ourselves flat upon the ground in corners where he was not
likely to touch us with his feet.

After a vain search he fumbled about till he found the door, and fled
out of it howling frightfully.  As for us, when he was gone we made
haste to leave the fatal castle, and, stationing ourselves beside our
rafts, we waited to see what would happen.  Our idea was that if, when
the sun rose, we saw nothing of the giant, and no longer heard his
howls, which still came faintly through the darkness, growing more and
more distant, we should conclude that he was dead, and that we might
safely stay upon the island and need not risk our lives upon the frail
rafts.  But alas! morning light showed us our enemy approaching us,
supported on either hand by two giants nearly as large and fearful as
himself, while a crowd of others followed close upon their heels.
Hesitating no longer we clambered upon our rafts and rowed with all our
might out to sea.  The giants, seeing their prey escaping them, seized
up huge pieces of rock, and wading into the water hurled them after us
with such good aim that all the rafts except the one I was upon were
swamped, and their luckless crews drowned, without our being able to do
anything to help them.  Indeed I and my two companions had all we could
do to keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants, but by dint of
hard rowing we at last gained the open sea.  Here we were at the mercy
of the winds and waves, which tossed us to and fro all that day and
night, but the next morning we found ourselves near an island, upon
which we gladly landed.

There we found delicious fruits, and having satisfied our hunger we
presently lay down to rest upon the shore.  Suddenly we were aroused by
a loud rustling noise, and starting up, saw that it was caused by an
immense snake which was gliding towards us over the sand.  So swiftly
it came that it had seized one of my comrades before he had time to
fly, and in spite of his cries and struggles speedily crushed the life
out of him in its mighty coils and proceeded to swallow him.  By this
time my other companion and I were running for our lives to some place
where we might hope to be safe from this new horror, and seeing a tall
tree we climbed up into it, having first provided ourselves with a
store of fruit off the surrounding bushes.  When night came I fell
asleep, but only to be awakened once more by the terrible snake, which
after hissing horribly round the tree at last reared itself up against
it, and finding my sleeping comrade who was perched just below me, it
swallowed him also, and crawled away leaving me half dead with terror.

When the sun rose I crept down from the tree with hardly a hope of
escaping the dreadful fate which had over-taken my comrades; but life
is sweet, and I determined to do all I could to save myself.  All day
long I toiled with frantic haste and collected quantities of dry
brushwood, reeds and thorns, which I bound with faggots, and making a
circle of them under my tree I piled them firmly one upon another until
I had a kind of tent in which I crouched like a mouse in a hole when
she sees the cat coming.  You may imagine what a fearful night I
passed, for the snake returned eager to devour me, and glided round and
round my frail shelter seeking an entrance.  Every moment I feared that
it would succeed in pushing aside some of the faggots, but happily for
me they held together, and when it grew light my enemy retired, baffled
and hungry, to his den.  As for me I was more dead than alive!  Shaking
with fright and half suffocated by the poisonous breath of the monster,
I came out of my tent and crawled down to the sea, feeling that it
would be better to plunge from the cliffs and end my life at once than
pass such another night of horror.  But to my joy and relief I saw a
ship sailing by, and by shouting wildly and waving my turban I managed
to attract the attention of her crew.

A boat was sent to rescue me, and very soon I found myself on board
surrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants eager to know
by what chance I found myself in that desolate island.  After I had
told my story they regaled me with the choicest food the ship afforded,
and the captain, seeing that I was in rags, generously bestowed upon me
one of his own coats.  After sailing about for some time and touching
at many ports we came at last to the island of Salahat, where sandal
wood grows in great abundance.  Here we anchored, and as I stood
watching the merchants disembarking their goods and preparing to sell
or exchange them, the captain came up to me and said,

"I have here, brother, some merchandise belonging to a passenger of
mine who is dead.  Will you do me the favour to trade with it, and when
I meet with his heirs I shall be able to give them the money, though it
will be only just that you shall have a portion for your trouble."

I consented gladly, for I did not like standing by idle.  Whereupon he
pointed the bales out to me, and sent for the person whose duty it was
to keep a list of the goods that were upon the ship.  When this man
came he asked in what name the merchandise was to be registered.

At this I was greatly surprised, but looking carefully at him I
recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made my
second voyage, though he had altered much since that time.  As for him,
believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me.

"Yes," he replied.  "He was so named.  He belonged to Bagdad, and
joined my ship at Balsora, but by mischance he was left behind upon a
desert island where we had landed to fill up our water-casks, and it
was not until four hours later that he was missed.  By that time the
wind had freshened, and it was impossible to put back for him."

"Why, captain!"  I cried, "look well at me.  I am that Sindbad who fell
asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself abandoned!"

The captain stared at me in amazement, but was presently convinced that
I was indeed speaking the truth, and rejoiced greatly at my escape.

"I am glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscience at any
rate," said he.  "Now take your goods, and the profit I have made for
you upon them, and may you prosper in future."

I took them gratefully, and as we went from one island to another I
laid in stores of cloves, cinnamon, and other spices.  In one place I
saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long and as many broad, also a
fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that it was used to make
shields.  Another I saw that was like a camel in shape and colour.  So
by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I returned to Bagdad with so
much money that I could not myself count it, besides treasures without
end.  I gave largely to the poor, and bought much land to add to what I
already possessed, and thus ended my third voyage.

When Sindbad had finished his story he gave another hundred sequins to
Hindbad, who then departed with the other guests, but next day when
they had all reassembled, and the banquet was ended, their host
continued his adventures.

Rich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not make up my
mind to stay at home altogether.  My love of trading, and the pleasure
I took in anything that was new and strange, made me set my affairs in
order, and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces,
having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the
different places I intended to visit.  I took ship at a distant
seaport, and for some time all went well, but at last, being caught in
a violent hurricane, our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all
our worthy captain could do to save her, and many of our company
perished in the waves.  I, with a few others, had the good fortune to
be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck, for the storm had
driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyond the reach of the
waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted, to wait for morning.

At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we
directed our steps.  As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed
out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their
houses, and as it were divided among our captors.  I with five others
was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground, and
certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs to us to
eat.  Observing that they themselves did not touch them, I was careful
only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions, being very
hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them, and very soon I had
the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad.  Though they chattered
incessantly I could not understand a word they said, nor did they heed
when I spoke to them.  The savages now produced large bowls full of
rice prepared with cocoanut oil, of which my crazy comrades ate
eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains, understanding clearly that the
object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating,
and this was exactly what happened.  My unlucky companions having lost
their reason, felt neither anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that
was offered them.  So they were soon fat and there was an end of them,
but I grew leaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that
little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me.
However, as I was so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to
wander about freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off upon
some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managed to
escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster the more he
cried to me to come back, until I had completely distanced him.

For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me,
and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat and
drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party of
white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about.  Reassured
by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards them and they
greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came.  My delight
was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied
their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured
by the blacks.  "But these savages devour men!" said they.  "How did
you escape?"  I repeated to them what I have just told you, at which
they were mightily astonished.  I stayed with them until they had
collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they took me back to
their own country and presented me to their king, by whom I was
hospitably received.  To him also I had to relate my adventures, which
surprised him much, and when I had finished he ordered that I should be
supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration.

The island on which I found myself was full of people, and abounded in
all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of traffic went on in
the capital, where I soon began to feel at home and contented.
Moreover, the king treated me with special favour, and in consequence
of this everyone, whether at the court or in the town, sought to make
life pleasant to me.  One thing I remarked which I thought very
strange; this was that, from the greatest to the least, all men rode
their horses without bridle or stirrups.  I one day presumed to ask his
majesty why he did not use them, to which he replied, "You speak to me
of things of which I have never before heard!"  This gave me an idea.
I found a clever workman, and made him cut out under my direction the
foundation of a saddle, which I wadded and covered with choice leather,
adorning it with rich gold embroidery.  I then got a lock-smith to make
me a bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him, and
when all these things were completed I presented them to the king and
showed him how to use them.  When I had saddled one of his horses he
mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty, and to show
his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts.  After this I had to
make saddles for all the principal officers of the king''s household,
and as they all gave me rich presents I soon became very wealthy and
quite an important person in the city.

One day the king sent for me and said, "Sindbad, I am going to ask a
favour of you.  Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wish you to end
your days amongst us.  Therefore I desire that you will marry a rich
and beautiful lady whom I will find for you, and think no more of your
own country."

As the king''s will was law I accepted the charming bride he presented
to me, and lived happily with her.  Nevertheless I had every intention
of escaping at the first opportunity, and going back to Bagdad.  Things
were thus going prosperously with me when it happened that the wife of
one of my neighbours, with whom I had struck up quite a friendship,
fell ill, and presently died.  I went to his house to offer my
consolations, and found him in the depths of woe.

"Come, come!" said I, "surely it is not so bad as all that.  I trust
that you may be spared to me for many years."

"I hope," answered he, "that your life may be long, but as for me, all
is finished.  I have set my house in order, and to-day I shall be
buried with my wife.  This has been the law upon our island from the
earliest ages--the living husband goes to the grave with his dead wife,
the living wife with her dead husband.  So did our fathers, and so must
we do.  The law changes not, and all must submit to it!"

As he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began to
assemble.  The body, decked in rich robes and sparkling with jewels,
was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started, taking its way
to a high mountain at some distance from the city, the wretched
husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle, following
mournfully.

When the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered, just as
it was, into a deep pit.  Then the husband, bidding farewell to all his
friends, stretched himself upon another bier, upon which were laid
seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and he also was
let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern, and then a
stone was laid over the opening, and the melancholy company wended its
way back to the city.

You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings;
to all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomed from
their youth up; but I was so horrified that I could not help telling
the king how it struck me.

"Sire," I said, "I am more astonished than I can express to you at the
strange custom which exists in your dominions of burying the living
with the dead.  In all my travels I have never before met with so cruel
and horrible a law."

"What would you have, Sindbad?" he replied.  "It is the law for
everybody.  I myself should be buried with the Queen if she were the
first to die."

"Why, yes," replied the king smiling, in what I could but consider a
very heartless manner, "they are no exception to the rule if they have
married in the country."

When I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that time
forward my mind was never easy.  If only my wife''s little finger ached
I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough before very long she
fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last.  My dismay was
great, for it seemed to me that to be buried alive was even a worse
fate than to be devoured by cannibals, nevertheless there was no
escape.  The body of my wife, arrayed in her richest robes and decked
with all her jewels, was laid upon the bier.  I followed it, and after
me came a great procession, headed by the king and all his nobles, and
in this order we reached the fatal mountain, which was one of a lofty
chain bordering the sea.

Here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the king and
those who stood by, hoping to save myself even at this last moment, but
it was of no avail.  No one spoke to me, they even appeared to hasten
over their dreadful task, and I speedily found myself descending into
the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and pitcher of water beside me.
Almost before I reached the bottom the stone was rolled into its place
above my head, and I was left to my fate.  A feeble ray of light shone
into the cavern through some chink, and when I had the courage to look
about me I could see that I was in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones
and bodies of the dead.  I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs
of those who, like myself, had come into this dismal place alive.  All
in vain did I shriek aloud with rage and despair, reproaching myself
for the love of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass,
but at length, growing calmer, I took up my bread and water, and
wrapping my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the end of the
cavern, where the air was fresher.

Here I lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were exhausted,
but just as I was nearly dead from starvation the rock was rolled away
overhead and I saw that a bier was being lowered into the cavern, and
that the corpse upon it was a man.  In a moment my mind was made up,
the woman who followed had nothing to expect but a lingering death; I
should be doing her a service if I shortened her misery.  Therefore
when she descended, already insensible from terror, I was ready armed
with a huge bone, one blow from which left her dead, and I secured the
bread and water which gave me a hope of life.  Several times did I have
recourse to this desperate expedient, and I know not how long I had
been a prisoner when one day I fancied that I heard something near me,
which breathed loudly.  Turning to the place from which the sound came
I dimly saw a shadowy form which fled at my movement, squeezing itself
through a cranny in the wall.  I pursued it as fast as I could, and
found myself in a narrow crack among the rocks, along which I was just
able to force my way.  I followed it for what seemed to me many miles,
and at last saw before me a glimmer of light which grew clearer every
moment until I emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot
describe.  When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it
was doubtless some little animal which had found its way into the
cavern from the sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of
escape which I could never have discovered for myself.  I hastily
surveyed my surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit from
the town.

The mountains sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no road
across them.  Being assured of this I returned to the cavern, and
amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and jewels of
all kinds which strewed the ground.  These I made up into bales, and
stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waited hopefully
for the passing of a ship.  I had looked out for two days, however,
before a single sail appeared, so it was with much delight that I at
last saw a vessel not very far from the shore, and by waving my arms
and uttering loud cries succeeded in attracting the attention of her
crew.  A boat was sent off to me, and in answer to the questions of the
sailors as to how I came to be in such a plight, I replied that I had
been shipwrecked two days before, but had managed to scramble ashore
with the bales which I pointed out to them.  Luckily for me they
believed my story, and without even looking at the place where they
found me, took up my bundles, and rowed me back to the ship.  Once on
board, I soon saw that the captain was too much occupied with the
difficulties of navigation to pay much heed to me, though he generously
made me welcome, and would not even accept the jewels with which I
offered to pay my passage.  Our voyage was prosperous, and after
visiting many lands, and collecting in each place great store of goodly
merchandise, I found myself at last in Bagdad once more with unheard of
riches of every description.  Again I gave large sums of money to the
poor, and enriched all the mosques in the city, after which I gave
myself up to my friends and relations, with whom I passed my time in
feasting and merriment.

Here Sindbad paused, and all his hearers declared that the adventures
of his fourth voyage had pleased them better than anything they had
heard before.  They then took their leave, followed by Hindbad, who had
once more received a hundred sequins, and with the rest had been bidden
to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage.

When the time came all were in their places, and when they had eaten
and drunk of all that was set before them Sindbad began his tale.

Not even all that I had gone through could make me contented with a
quiet life.  I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for change and
adventure.  Therefore I set out once more, but this time in a ship of
my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest seaport.  I wished
to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own time; but as
I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo, I invited
several merchants of different nations to join me.  We set sail with
the first favourable wind, and after a long voyage upon the open seas
we landed upon an unknown island which proved to be uninhabited.  We
determined, however, to explore it, but had not gone far when we found
a roc''s egg, as large as the one I had seen before and evidently very
nearly hatched, for the beak of the young bird had already pierced the
shell.  In spite of all I could say to deter them, the merchants who
were with me fell upon it with their hatchets, breaking the shell, and
killing the young roc.  Then lighting a fire upon the ground they
hacked morsels from the bird, and proceeded to roast them while I stood
by aghast.

Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the air above
us was darkened by two mighty shadows.  The captain of my ship, knowing
by experience what this meant, cried out to us that the parent birds
were coming, and urged us to get on board with all speed.  This we did,
and the sails were hoisted, but before we had made any way the rocs
reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it, uttering frightful
cries when they discovered the mangled remains of their young one.  For
a moment we lost sight of them, and were flattering ourselves that we
had escaped, when they reappeared and soared into the air directly over
our vessel, and we saw that each held in its claws an immense rock
ready to crush us.  There was a moment of breathless suspense, then one
bird loosed its hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the
air, but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman, who turned our
ship violently in another direction, it fell into the sea close beside
us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom.  We had
hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fell with
a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel, smashing it
into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into the sea,
passengers and crew.  I myself went down with the rest, but had the
good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a piece of driftwood
with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myself afloat and was
presently washed up by the tide on to an island.  Its shores were steep
and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw myself down to rest upon
the green turf.

When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in which I
found myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached a garden of
delights.  There were trees everywhere, and they were laden with
flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and out under
their shadow.  When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook, though
the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me sometimes
start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished heartily that I
had stayed at home at ease.  However, the morning sunlight restored my
courage, and I once more wandered among the trees, but always with some
anxiety as to what I might see next.  I had penetrated some distance
into the island when I saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the
river bank, and at first I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner
like myself.  Going up to him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he
only nodded his head at me in reply.  I then asked what he did there,
and he made signs to me that he wished to get across the river to
gather some fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back.
Pitying his age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the
stream I bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade
him get down.  But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet
(even now it makes me laugh to think of it!), this creature who had
seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking
his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh
choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the
ground.  When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he
had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me
revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the
other, until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under
the trees while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits.  This went on
all day, and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with
weariness, the terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he
fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me
with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with
rage and bitterness in my heart.

It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several dry
gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping out its
contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of grapes
which hung from every bush.  When it was full I left it propped in the
fork of a tree, and a few days later, carrying the hateful old man that
way, I snatched at my gourd as I passed it and had the satisfaction of
a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that I even forgot
my detestable burden, and began to sing and caper.

The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught
had produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so he
stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted its
contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop.  The wine
was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also began to sing after a
fashion, and soon I had the delight of feeling the iron grip of his
goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorous effort I threw him to the
ground, from which he never moved again.  I was so rejoiced to have at
last got rid of this uncanny old man that I ran leaping and bounding
down to the sea shore, where, by the greatest good luck, I met with
some mariners who had anchored off the island to enjoy the delicious
fruits, and to renew their supply of water.

They heard the story of my escape with amazement, saying, "You fell
into the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and it is a mercy that he did
not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose shoulders he has
managed to perch himself.  This island is well known as the scene of
his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who lands upon it cares to
stray far away from his comrades."  After we had talked for a while
they took me back with them on board their ship, where the captain
received me kindly, and we soon set sail, and after several days
reached a large and prosperous-looking town where all the houses were
built of stone.  Here we anchored, and one of the merchants, who had
been very friendly to me on the way, took me ashore with him and showed
me a lodging set apart for strange merchants.  He then provided me with
a large sack, and pointed out to me a party of others equipped in like
manner.

"Go with them," said he, "and do as they do, but beware of losing sight
of them, for if you strayed your life would be in danger."

With that he supplied me with provisions, and bade me farewell, and I
set out with my new companions.  I soon learnt that the object of our
expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts, but when at length I
saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery
smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not at all understand how we
were to do it.  The crowns of the cocoa-palms were all alive with
monkeys, big and little, which skipped from one to the other with
surprising agility, seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our
appearance, and I was at first surprised when my companions after
collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures, which
seemed to me quite harmless.  But very soon I saw the reason of it and
joined them heartily, for the monkeys, annoyed and wishing to pay us
back in our own coin, began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast
them at us with angry and spiteful gestures, so that after very little
labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not
otherwise have obtained.

As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town,
where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the same
occupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to my own
country.  This I did, and before long had amassed a considerable sum.
Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail, and
taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with me a goodly
store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islands where pepper
grows, then to Comari where the best aloes wood is found, and where men
drink no wine by an unalterable law.  Here I exchanged my nuts for
pepper and good aloes wood, and went a-fishing for pearls with some of
the other merchants, and my divers were so lucky that very soon I had
an immense number, and those very large and perfect.  With all these
treasures I came joyfully back to Bagdad, where I disposed of them for
large sums of money, of which I did not fail as before to give the
tenth part to the poor, and after that I rested from my labours and
comforted myself with all the pleasures that my riches could give me.

Having thus ended his story, Sindbad ordered that one hundred sequins
should be given to Hindbad, and the guests then withdrew; but after the
next day''s feast he began the account of his sixth voyage as follows.

It must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met with
shipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and risk
fresh trouble.  I am even surprised myself when I look back, but
evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose I prepared
to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties of my friends and
relations, who did all they could to keep me at home.  Instead of going
by the Persian Gulf, I travelled a considerable way overland, and
finally embarked from a distant Indian port with a captain who meant to
make a long voyage.  And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy
weather which drove us completely out of our course, so that for many
days neither captain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were
going.  When they did at last discover our position we had small ground
for rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deck and
tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerous spot
upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which was at
that minute sweeping us to destruction.  It was too true!  In spite of
all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards
the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer out of the sea, and our vessel
was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at its base, not, however, until we
had managed to scramble on shore, carrying with us the most precious of
our possessions.  When we had done this the captain said to us:

"Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once, since
from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned."

The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island, and the
narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn with the
wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones of the luckless
mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we shuddered to think how
soon our own would be added to the heap.  All around, too, lay vast
quantities of the costliest merchandise, and treasures were heaped in
every cranny of the rocks, but all these things only added to the
desolation of the scene.  It struck me as a very strange thing that a
river of clear fresh water, which gushed out from the mountain not far
from where we stood, instead of flowing into the sea as rivers
generally do, turned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a
natural archway of rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I
found that inside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds, and
rubies, and masses of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris.
Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to our
fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain, and if a
ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom.  The first thing
our captain did was to divide equally amongst us all the food we
possessed, and then the length of each man''s life depended on the time
he could make his portion last.  I myself could live upon very little.

Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companions my
stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I should live
long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing, while I
regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always bringing me
into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort and luxury
that I had left.  But luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once
more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of
the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me.  This river which hid
itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot.  Why
should I not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing
waters?  If I perished before I could reach the light of day once more
I should be no worse off than I was now, for death stared me in the
face, while there was always the possibility that, as I was born under
a lucky star, I might find myself safe and sound in some desirable
land.  I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a
stout raft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to
spare lay strewn upon the beach.  I then made up many packages of
rubies, emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and
bound them upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and
then I seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had
fashioned laid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to
the bank.  Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the
gloomy archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly
forward by the rapid river.  On I went as it seemed to me for many
nights and days.  Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow
escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I took
the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales.  Though I only ate
what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive, the inevitable
moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel of food, I began to
wonder if I must after all die of hunger.  Then, worn out with anxiety
and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep, and when I again opened my eyes
I was once more in the light of day; a beautiful country lay before me,
and my raft, which was tied to the river bank, was surrounded by
friendly looking black men.  I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to
me in return, but I could not understand a word of their language.
Feeling perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I
murmured to myself in Arabic, "Close thine eyes, and while thou
sleepest Heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good."

"My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we
came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating down it,
and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore.  We have waited
for your awakening; tell us now whence you come and where you were
going by that dangerous way?"

I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them, but
that I was starving, and would fain eat something first.  I was soon
supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied my hunger I told them
faithfully all that had befallen me.  They were lost in wonder at my
tale when it was interpreted to them, and said that adventures so
surprising must be related to their king only by the man to whom they
had happened.  So, procuring a horse, they mounted me upon it, and we
set out, followed by several strong men carrying my raft just as it was
upon their shoulders.  In this order we marched into the city of
Serendib, where the natives presented me to their king, whom I saluted
in the Indian fashion, prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the
ground; but the monarch bade me rise and sit beside him, asking first
what was my name.

I told my story, concealing nothing, and his surprise and delight were
so great that he ordered my adventures to be written in letters of gold
and laid up in the archives of his kingdom.

Presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his presence,
and the king declared that in all his treasury there were no such
rubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps before him.
Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured to say that I
myself and all that I had were at his disposal, but he answered me
smiling:

"Nay, Sindbad.  Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches; I will
rather add to them, for I desire that you shall not leave my kingdom
without some tokens of my good will."  He then commanded his officers
to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense, and sent slaves
to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to my new dwelling
place.  You may imagine that I praised his generosity and gave him
grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself daily in his audience
chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused myself in seeing all that
was most worthy of attention in the city.  The island of Serendib being
situated on the equinoctial line, the days and nights there are of
equal length.  The chief city is placed at the end of a beautiful
valley, formed by the highest mountain in the world, which is in the
middle of the island.  I had the curiosity to ascend to its very
summit, for this was the place to which Adam was banished out of
Paradise.  Here are found rubies and many precious things, and rare
plants grow abundantly, with cedar trees and cocoa palms.  On the
seashore and at the mouths of the rivers the divers seek for pearls,
and in some valleys diamonds are plentiful.  After many days I
petitioned the king that I might return to my own country, to which he
graciously consented.  Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when
I went to take leave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a
letter to the Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, "I
pray you give these to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, and assure him of
my friendship."

I accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked upon the vessel
which the king himself had chosen for me.  The king''s letter was
written in blue characters upon a rare and precious skin of yellowish
colour, and these were the words of it: "The King of the Indies, before
whom walk a thousand elephants, who lives in a palace, of which the
roof blazes with a hundred thousand rubies, and whose treasure house
contains twenty thousand diamond crowns, to the Caliph Haroun al
Raschid sends greeting.  Though the offering we present to you is
unworthy of your notice, we pray you to accept it as a mark of the
esteem and friendship which we cherish for you, and of which we gladly
send you this token, and we ask of you a like regard if you deem us
worthy of it.  Adieu, brother."

The present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby, six inches
high and as thick as my finger; this was filled with the choicest
pearls, large, and of perfect shape and lustre; secondly, a huge snake
skin, with scales as large as a sequin, which would preserve from
sickness those who slept upon it.  Then quantities of aloes wood,
camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly, a beautiful slave girl, whose
robes glittered with precious stones.

After a long and prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I made
haste to reach Bagdad, and taking the king''s letter I presented myself
at the palace gate, followed by the beautiful slave, and various
members of my own family, bearing the treasure.

As soon as I had declared my errand I was conducted into the presence
of the Caliph, to whom, after I had made my obeisance, I gave the
letter and the king''s gift, and when he had examined them he demanded
of me whether the Prince of Serendib was really as rich and powerful as
he claimed to be.

"Commander of the Faithful," I replied, again bowing humbly before him,
"I can assure your Majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealth
and grandeur.  Nothing can equal the magnificence of his palace.  When
he goes abroad his throne is prepared upon the back of an elephant, and
on either side of him ride his ministers, his favourites, and
courtiers.  On his elephant''s neck sits an officer, his golden lance in
his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold, at
the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand.  A thousand men in
cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants, go before
him, and as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his
elephant cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch, the powerful and
valiant Sultan of the Indies, whose palace is covered with a hundred
thousand rubies, who possesses twenty thousand diamond crowns.  Behold
a monarch greater than Solomon and Mihrage in all their glory!''"

"Then the one who stands behind the throne answers:  ''This king, so
great and powerful, must die, must die, must die!''"

"Further, my lord, in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the king
himself his people come for justice."

"From the king''s letter," said he, "I judged that he was a wise man.
It seems that he is worthy of his people, and his people of him."

When Sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad having
first received a hundred sequins, but all returned next day to hear the
story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus began.

After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go to sea no
more.  I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life, and I had run
risks enough.  I only wished to end my days in peace.  One day,
however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends, I was told
that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me, and when he was
admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of Haroun al Raschid,
which I accordingly did.  After I had saluted him, the Caliph said:

"I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services.  I have
chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib in
return for his message of friendship."

"Commander of the Faithful," I answered, "I am ready to do all that
your Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am
utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone.
Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave Bagdad."

With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures,
to which he listened patiently.

"I admit," said he, "that you have indeed had some extraordinary
experiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing as
I wish.  You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my message,
then you are free to come back and do as you will.  But go you must; my
honour and dignity demand it."

Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing to
obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way, gave me a
thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage.  I was soon ready to
start, and taking the letter and the present I embarked at Balsora, and
sailed quickly and safely to Serendib.  Here, when I had disclosed my
errand, I was well received, and brought into the presence of the king,
who greeted me with joy.

After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed the
Caliph''s gifts.  First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold,
which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff.
Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest white linen
from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria.  Then more beds of different
fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figure of a man aiming an
arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table, which had once belonged to
King Solomon.  The King of Serendib received with satisfaction the
assurance of the Caliph''s friendliness toward him, and now my task
being accomplished I was anxious to depart, but it was some time before
the king would think of letting me go.  At last, however, he dismissed
me with many presents, and I lost no time in going on board a ship,
which sailed at once, and for four days all went well.  On the fifth
day we had the misfortune to fall in with pirates, who seized our
vessel, killing all who resisted, and making prisoners of those who
were prudent enough to submit at once, of whom I was one.  When they
had despoiled us of all we possessed, they forced us to put on vile
raiment, and sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves.  I
fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who took me home with him, and
clothed and fed me well, and after some days sent for me and questioned
me as to what I could do.

I answered that I was a rich merchant who had been captured by pirates,
and therefore I knew no trade.

I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth, and that
doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me.

Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with
him upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay far
from the town.  When we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped,
and my master said to me:  "This forest swarms with elephants.  Hide
yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that pass you.  When you
have succeeded in killing one come and tell me."

So saying he gave me a supply of food, and returned to the town, and I
perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch.  That night I saw
nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a large herd of
elephants came crashing and trampling by.  I lost no time in letting
fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals fell to the
ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free to come down
from my hiding place and run back to tell my master of my success, for
which I was praised and regaled with good things.  Then we went back to
the forest together and dug a mighty trench in which we buried the
elephant I had killed, in order that when it became a skeleton my
master might return and secure its tusks.

For two months I hunted thus, and no day passed without my securing, an
elephant.  Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree,
but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another.  One morning as I
watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that,
instead of passing the tree I was in, as they usually did, they paused,
and completely surrounded it, trumpeting horribly, and shaking the very
ground with their heavy tread, and when I saw that their eyes were
fixed upon me I was terrified, and my arrows dropped from my trembling
hand.  I had indeed good reason for my terror when, an instant later,
the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree,
and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots, bringing me to the
ground entangled in its branches.  I thought now that my last hour was
surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up gently enough, set me
upon its back, where I clung more dead than alive, and followed by the
whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest.  It seemed to
me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant,
and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd, which turned and
trampled off in another direction, and were soon hidden in the dense
underwood.  Then, recovering myself, I looked about me, and found that
I was standing upon the side of a great hill, strewn as far as I could
see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants.  "This then must
be the elephants'' burying place," I said to myself, "and they must have
brought me here that I might cease to persecute them, seeing that I
want nothing but their tusks, and here lie more than I could carry away
in a lifetime."

Whereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go, not
seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me that they had
retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open to the Ivory Hill,
and I did not know how sufficiently to admire their sagacity.  After a
day and a night I reached my master''s house, and was received by him
with joyful surprise.

"Ah! poor Sindbad," he cried, "I was wondering what could have become
of you.  When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted, and
the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should never see you again.
Pray tell me how you escaped death."

I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together to
the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had told him
nothing but the truth.  When we had loaded our elephant with as many
tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city, he said:

"My brother--since I can no longer treat as a slave one who has
enriched me thus--take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you.  I will
no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have killed
numbers of our slaves every year.  No matter what good advice we gave
them, they were caught sooner or later.  You alone have escaped the
wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the special
protection of Heaven.  Now through you the whole town will be enriched
without further loss of life, therefore you shall not only receive your
liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon you."

To which I replied, "Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity.
For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own country."

"It is well," he answered, "the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships
hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat to pay your
passage."

So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and every day we
added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houses were overflowing
with it.  By this time the other merchants knew the secret, but there
was enough and to spare for all.  When the ships at last arrived my
master himself chose the one in which I was to sail, and put on board
for me a great store of choice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and
all the costliest curiosities of the country, for which I could not
thank him enough, and so we parted.  I left the ship at the first port
we came to, not feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had
happened to me by reason of it, and having disposed of my ivory for
much gold, and bought many rare and costly presents, I loaded my pack
animals, and joined a caravan of merchants.  Our journey was long and
tedious, but I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had not to
fear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils
from which I had suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad.  My
first care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give him an
account of my embassy.  He assured me that my long absence had
disquieted him much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best.  As to
my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement, declaring
that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness been well
known to him.

By his orders this story and the others I had told him were written by
his scribes in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures.  I
took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honours and rewards he
bestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested from my labours,
and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends.

"Well, my friend, and what do you think now?  Have you ever heard of
anyone who has suffered more, or had more narrow escapes than I have?
Is it not just that I should now enjoy a life of ease and tranquillity?"

Hindbad drew near, and kissing his hand respectfully, replied, "Sir,
you have indeed known fearful perils; my troubles have been nothing
compared to yours.  Moreover, the generous use you make of your wealth
proves that you deserve it.  May you live long and happily in the
enjoyment in it."

Sindbad then gave him a hundred sequins, and hence-forward counted him
among his friends; also he caused him to give up his profession as a
porter, and to eat daily at his table that he might all his life
remember Sindbad the Sailor.

In the kingdom of Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows, situated on
the frontiers of Great Tartary, there lived long ago a tailor and his
wife who loved each other very much.  One day, when the tailor was hard
at work, a little hunchback came and sat at the entrance of the shop,
and began to sing and play his tambourine.  The tailor was amused with
the antics of the fellow, and thought he would take him home to divert
his wife.  The hunchback having agreed to his proposal, the tailor
closed his shop and they set off together.

When they reached the house they found the table ready laid for supper,
and in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a beautiful
fish which the tailor''s wife had cooked with her own hands.  But
unluckily, the hunchback happened to swallow a large bone, and, in
spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him, died of
suffocation in an instant.  Besides being very sorry for the poor man,
the tailor and his wife were very much frightened on their own account,
for if the police came to hear of it the worthy couple ran the risk of
being thrown into prison for wilful murder.  In order to prevent this
dreadful calamity they both set about inventing some plan which would
throw suspicion on some one else, and at last they made up their minds
that they could do no better than select a Jewish doctor who lived
close by as the author of the crime.  So the tailor picked up the
hunchback by his head while his wife took his feet and carried him to
the doctor''s house.  Then they knocked at the door, which opened
straight on to a steep staircase.  A servant soon appeared, feeling her
way down the dark staircase and inquired what they wanted.

"Tell your master," said the tailor, "that we have brought a very sick
man for him to cure; and," he added, holding out some money, "give him
this in advance, so that he may not feel he is wasting his time." The
servant remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor, and the
moment she was out of sight the tailor and his wife carried the body
swiftly after her, propped it up at the top of the staircase, and ran
home as fast as their legs could carry them.

Now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient (for he was
young, and had not many of them), that he was transported with joy.

"Get a light," he called to the servant, "and follow me as fast as you
can!" and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase.  There
he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback, and without knowing what
it was gave it such a kick that it rolled right to the bottom, and very
nearly dragged the doctor after it.  "A light! a light!" he cried
again, and when it was brought and he saw what he had done he was
almost beside himself with terror.

"Holy Moses!" he exclaimed, "why did I not wait for the light?  I have
killed the sick man whom they brought me; and if the sacred Ass of
Esdras does not come to my aid I am lost!  It will not be long before I
am led to jail as a murderer."

Agitated though he was, and with reason, the doctor did not forget to
shut the house door, lest some passers-by might chance to see what had
happened.  He then took up the corpse and carried it into his wife''s
room, nearly driving her crazy with fright.

"It is all over with us!" she wailed, "if we cannot find some means of
getting the body out of the house.  Once let the sun rise and we can
hide it no longer!  How were you driven to commit such a terrible
crime?"

For a long while the doctor and his wife continued to turn over in
their minds a way of escape, but could not find any that seemed good
enough.  At last the doctor gave it up altogether and resigned himself
to bear the penalty of his misfortune.

But his wife, who had twice his brains, suddenly exclaimed, "I have
thought of something!  Let us carry the body on the roof of the house
and lower it down the chimney of our neighbour the Mussulman." Now this
Mussulman was employed by the Sultan, and furnished his table with oil
and butter.  Part of his house was occupied by a great storeroom, where
rats and mice held high revel.

The doctor jumped at his wife''s plan, and they took up the hunchback,
and passing cords under his armpits they let him down into the
purveyor''s bed-room so gently that he really seemed to be leaning
against the wall.  When they felt he was touching the ground they drew
up the cords and left him.

Scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyor entered
his room.  He had spent the evening at a wedding feast, and had a
lantern in his hand.  In the dim light it cast he was astonished to see
a man standing in his chimney, but being naturally courageous he seized
a stick and made straight for the supposed thief.  "Ah!" he cried, "so
it is you, and not the rats and mice, who steal my butter.  I''ll take
care that you don''t want to come back!"

So saying he struck him several hard blows.  The corpse fell on the
floor, but the man only redoubled his blows, till at length it occurred
to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and make no
resistance.  Then, finding he was quite dead, a cold fear took
possession of him.  "Wretch that I am," said he, "I have murdered a
man.  Ah, my revenge has gone too far.  Without the help of Allah I am
undone!  Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin." And already
he felt the rope round his neck.

But when he had got over the first shock he began to think of some way
out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his arms he carried
him out into the street, and leaning him against the wall of a shop he
stole back to his own house, without once looking behind him.

A few minutes before the sun rose, a rich Christian merchant, who
supplied the palace with all sorts of necessaries, left his house,
after a night of feasting, to go to the bath.  Though he was very
drunk, he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at hand, and
that all good Mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer.  So he
hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his way to the
mosque, who, seeing his condition, would send him to prison as a
drunkard.  In his haste he jostled against the hunchback, who fell
heavily upon him, and the merchant, thinking he was being attacked by a
thief, knocked him down with one blow of his fist.  He then called
loudly for help, beating the fallen man all the while.

The chief policeman of the quarter came running up, and found a
Christian ill-treating a Mussulman.  "What are you doing?" he asked
indignantly.

"Well, you have had your revenge," said the man, catching hold of his
arm.  "Come, be off with you!"

As he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him up, but
the hunchback never moved.  "Oho!" he went on, looking closer, "so this
is the way a Christian has the impudence to treat a Mussulman!" and
seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he took him to the inspector of
police, who threw him into prison till the judge should be out of bed
and ready to attend to his case.  All this brought the merchant to his
senses, but the more he thought of it the less he could understand how
the hunchback could have died merely from the blows he had received.

The merchant was still pondering on this subject when he was summoned
before the chief of police and questioned about his crime, which he
could not deny.  As the hunchback was one of the Sultan''s private
jesters, the chief of police resolved to defer sentence of death until
he had consulted his master.  He went to the palace to demand an
audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only answered,

So the chief of police ordered a gallows to be erected, and sent criers
to proclaim in every street in the city that a Christian was to be
hanged that day for having killed a Mussulman.

When all was ready the merchant was brought from prison and led to the
foot of the gallows.  The executioner knotted the cord firmly round the
unfortunate man''s neck and was just about to swing him into the air,
when the Sultan''s purveyor dashed through the crowd, and cried,
panting, to the hangman,

The chief of police, who was present to see that everything was in
order, put several questions to the purveyor, who told him the whole
story of the death of the hunchback, and how he had carried the body to
the place where it had been found by the Christian merchant.

"You are going," he said to the chief of police, "to kill an innocent
man, for it is impossible that he should have murdered a creature who
was dead already.  It is bad enough for me to have slain a Mussulman
without having it on my conscience that a Christian who is guiltless
should suffer through my fault."

Now the purveyor''s speech had been made in a loud voice, and was heard
by all the crowd, and even if he had wished it, the chief of police
could not have escaped setting the merchant free.

"Loose the cords from the Christian''s neck," he commanded, turning to
the executioner, "and hang this man in his place, seeing that by his
own confession he is the murderer."

The hangman did as he was bid, and was tying the cord firmly, when he
was stopped by the voice of the Jewish doctor beseeching him to pause,
for he had something very important to say.  When he had fought his way
through the crowd and reached the chief of police,

"Worshipful sir," he began, "this Mussulman whom you desire to hang is
unworthy of death; I alone am guilty.  Last night a man and a woman who
were strangers to me knocked at my door, bringing with them a patient
for me to cure.  The servant opened it, but having no light was hardly
able to make out their faces, though she readily agreed to wake me and
to hand me the fee for my services.  While she was telling me her story
they seem to have carried the sick man to the top of the staircase and
then left him there.  I jumped up in a hurry without waiting for a
lantern, and in the darkness I fell against something, which tumbled
headlong down the stairs and never stopped till it reached the bottom.
When I examined the body I found it was quite dead, and the corpse was
that of a hunchback Mussulman.  Terrified at what we had done, my wife
and I took the body on the roof and let it down the chimney of our
neighbour the purveyor, whom you were just about to hang.  The
purveyor, finding him in his room, naturally thought he was a thief,
and struck him such a blow that the man fell down and lay motionless on
the floor.  Stooping to examine him, and finding him stone dead, the
purveyor supposed that the man had died from the blow he had received;
but of course this was a mistake, as you will see from my account, and
I only am the murderer; and although I am innocent of any wish to
commit a crime, I must suffer for it all the same, or else have the
blood of two Musselmans on my conscience.  Therefore send away this
man, I pray you, and let me take his place, as it is I who am guilty."

On hearing the declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of police
commanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the Sultan''s
purveyor go free.  The cord was placed round the Jew''s neck, and his
feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the voice of the
tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause one moment and to
listen to what he had to say.

"Oh, my lord," he cried, turning to the chief of police, "how nearly
have you caused the death of three innocent people!  But if you will
only have the patience to listen to my tale, you shall know who is the
real culprit.  If some one has to suffer, it must be me!  Yesterday, at
dusk, I was working in my shop with a light heart when the little
hunchback, who was more than half drunk, came and sat in the doorway.
He sang me several songs, and then I invited him to finish the evening
at my house.  He accepted my invitation, and we went away together.  At
supper I helped him to a slice of fish, but in eating it a bone stuck
in his throat, and in spite of all we could do he died in a few
minutes.  We felt deeply sorry for his death, but fearing lest we
should be held responsible, we carried the corpse to the house of the
Jewish doctor.  I knocked, and desired the servant to beg her master to
come down as fast as possible and see a sick man whom we had brought
for him to cure; and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece
of money in her hand as the doctor''s fee.  Directly she had disappeared
I dragged the body to the top of the stairs, and then hurried away with
my wife back to our house.  In descending the stairs the doctor
accidentally knocked over the corpse, and finding him dead believed
that he himself was the murderer.  But now you know the truth set him
free, and let me die in his stead."

The chief of police and the crowd of spectators were lost in
astonishment at the strange events to which the death of the hunchback
had given rise.

"Loosen the Jewish doctor," said he to the hangman, "and string up the
tailor instead, since he has made confession of his crime.  Really, one
cannot deny that this is a very singular story, and it deserves to be
written in letters of gold."

The executioner speedily untied the knots which confined the doctor,
and was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor, when the Sultan
of Kashgar, who had missed his jester, happened to make inquiry of his
officers as to what had become of him.

"Sire," replied they, "the hunchback having drunk more than was good
for him, escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about the town,
where this morning he was found dead.  A man was arrested for having
caused his death, and held in custody till a gallows was erected.  At
the moment that he was about to suffer punishment, first one man
arrived, and then another, each accusing themselves of the murder, and
this went on for a long time, and at the present instant the chief of
police is engaged in questioning a man who declares that he alone is
the true assassin."

The Sultan of Kashgar no sooner heard these words than he ordered an
usher to go to the chief of police and to bring all the persons
concerned in the hunchback''s death, together with the corpse, that he
wished to see once again.  The usher hastened on his errand, but was
only just in time, for the tailor was positively swinging in the air,
when his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd, commanding the
hangman to cut down the body.  The hangman, recognising the usher as
one of the king''s servants, cut down the tailor, and the usher, seeing
the man was safe, sought the chief of police and gave him the Sultan''s
message.  Accordingly, the chief of police at once set out for the
palace, taking with him the tailor, the doctor, the purveyor, and the
merchant, who bore the dead hunchback on their shoulders.

When the procession reached the palace the chief of police prostrated
himself at the feet of the Sultan, and related all that he knew of the
matter.  The Sultan was so much struck by the circumstances that he
ordered his private historian to write down an exact account of what
had passed, so that in the years to come the miraculous escape of the
four men who had thought themselves murderers might never be forgotten.

The Sultan asked everybody concerned in the hunchback''s affair to tell
him their stories.  Among others was a prating barber, whose tale of
one of his brothers follows.

As long as our father lived Alnaschar was very idle.  Instead of
working for his bread he was not ashamed to ask for it every evening,
and to support himself next day on what he had received the night
before.  When our father died, worn out by age, he only left seven
hundred silver drachmas to be divided amongst us, which made one
hundred for each son.  Alnaschar, who had never possessed so much money
in his life, was quite puzzled to know what to do with it.  After
reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided to lay it out on
glasses, bottles, and things of that sort, which he would buy from a
wholesale merchant.  Having bought his stock he next proceeded to look
out for a small shop in a good position, where he sat down at the open
door, his wares being piled up in an uncovered basket in front of him,
waiting for a customer among the passers-by.

In this attitude he remained seated, his eyes fixed on the basket, but
his thoughts far away.  Unknown to himself he began to talk out loud,
and a tailor, whose shop was next door to his, heard quite plainly what
he was saying.

"This basket," said Alnaschar to himself, "has cost me a hundred
drachmas--all that I possess in the world.  Now in selling the
contents piece by piece I shall turn two hundred, and these hundreds I
shall again lay out in glass, which will produce four hundred.  By this
means I shall in course of time make four thousand drachmas, which will
easily double themselves.  When I have got ten thousand I will give up
the glass trade and become a jeweller, and devote all my time to
trading in pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones.  At last,
having all the wealth that heart can desire, I will buy a beautiful
country house, with horses and slaves, and then I will lead a merry
life and entertain my friends.  At my feasts I will send for musicians
and dancers from the neighbouring town to amuse my guests.  In spite of
my riches I shall not, however, give up trade till I have amassed a
capital of a hundred thousand drachmas, when, having become a man of
much consideration, I shall request the hand of the grand-vizir''s
daughter, taking care to inform the worthy father that I have heard
favourable reports of her beauty and wit, and that I will pay down on
our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces.  Should the vizir refuse my
proposal, which after all is hardly to be expected, I will seize him by
the beard and drag him to my house."

When I shall have married his daughter I will give her ten of the best
eunuchs that can be found for her service.  Then I shall put on my most
gorgeous robes, and mounted on a horse with a saddle of fine gold, and
its trappings blazing with diamonds, followed by a train of slaves, I
shall present myself at the house of the grand-vizir, the people
casting down their eyes and bowing low as I pass along.  At the foot of
the grand-vizir''s staircase I shall dismount, and while my servants
stand in a row to right and left I shall ascend the stairs, at the head
of which the grand-vizir will be waiting to receive me.  He will then
embrace me as his son-in-law, and giving me his seat will place himself
below me.  This being done (as I have every reason to expect), two of
my servants will enter, each bearing a purse containing a thousand
pieces of gold.  One of these I shall present to him saying, "Here are
the thousand gold pieces that I offered for your daughter''s hand, and
here," I shall continue, holding out the second purse, "are another
thousand to show you that I am a man who is better than his word."
After hearing of such generosity the world will talk of nothing else.

I shall return home with the same pomp as I set out, and my wife will
send an officer to compliment me on my visit to her father, and I shall
confer on the officer the honour of a rich dress and a handsome gift.
Should she send one to me I shall refuse it and dismiss the bearer.  I
shall never allow my wife to leave her rooms on any pretext whatever
without my permission, and my visits to her will be marked by all the
ceremony calculated to inspire respect.  No establishment will be
better ordered than mine, and I shall take care always to be dressed in
a manner suitable to my position.  In the evening, when we retire to
our apartments, I shall sit in the place of honour, where I shall
assume a grand demeanour and speak little, gazing straight before me,
and when my wife, lovely as the full moon, stands humbly in front of my
chair I shall pretend not to see her.  Then her women will say to me,
"Respected lord and master, your wife and slave is before you waiting
to be noticed.  She is mortified that you never deign to look her way;
she is tired of standing so long.  Beg her, we pray you, to be seated."
Of course I shall give no signs of even hearing this speech, which will
vex them mightily.  They will throw themselves at my feet with
lamentations, and at length I will raise my head and throw a careless
glance at her, then I shall go back to my former attitude.  The women
will think that I am displeased at my wife''s dress and will lead her
away to put on a finer one, and I on my side shall replace the one I am
wearing with another yet more splendid.  They will then return to the
charge, but this time it will take much longer before they persuade me
even to look at my wife.  It is as well to begin on my wedding-day as I
mean to go on for the rest of our lives.

The next day she will complain to her mother of the way she has been
treated, which will fill my heart with joy.  Her mother will come to
seek me, and, kissing my hands with respect, will say, "My lord" (for
she could not dare to risk my anger by using the familiar title of
"son-in-law"), "My lord, do not, I implore you, refuse to look upon my
daughter or to approach her.  She only lives to please you, and loves
you with all her soul." But I shall pay no more heed to my
mother-in-law''s words than I did to those of the women.  Again she will
beseech me to listen to her entreaties, throwing herself this time at
my feet, but all to no purpose.  Then, putting a glass of wine into my
wife''s hand, she will say to her, "There, present that to him yourself,
he cannot have the cruelty to reject anything offered by so beautiful a
hand," and my wife will take it and offer it to me tremblingly with
tears in her eyes, but I shall look in the other direction.  This will
cause her to weep still more, and she will hold out the glass crying,
"Adorable husband, never shall I cease my prayers till you have done me
the favour to drink."  Sick of her importunities, these words will goad
me to fury.  I shall dart an angry look at her and give her a sharp
blow on the cheek, at the same time giving her a kick so violent that
she will stagger across the room and fall on to the sofa.

"My brother," pursued the barber, "was so much absorbed in his dreams
that he actually did give a kick with his foot, which unluckily hit the
basket of glass.  It fell into the street and was instantly broken into
a thousand pieces."

His neighbour the tailor, who had been listening to his visions, broke
into a loud fit of laughter as he saw this sight.

"Wretched man!" he cried, "you ought to die of shame at behaving so to
a young wife who has done nothing to you.  You must be a brute for her
tears and prayers not to touch your heart.  If I were the grand-vizir I
would order you a hundred blows from a bullock whip, and would have you
led round the town accompanied by a herald who should proclaim your
crimes."

The accident, so fatal to all his profits, had restored my brother to
his senses, and seeing that the mischief had been caused by his own
insufferable pride, he rent his clothes and tore his hair, and lamented
himself so loudly that the passers-by stopped to listen.  It was a
Friday, so these were more numerous than usual.  Some pitied Alnaschar,
others only laughed at him, but the vanity which had gone to his head
had disappeared with his basket of glass, and he was loudly bewailing
his folly when a lady, evidently a person of consideration, rode by on
a mule.  She stopped and inquired what was the matter, and why the man
wept.  They told her that he was a poor man who had laid out all his
money on this basket of glass, which was now broken.  On hearing the
cause of these loud wails the lady turned to her attendant and said to
him, "Give him whatever you have got with you."  The man obeyed, and
placed in my brother''s hands a purse containing five hundred pieces of
gold.  Alnaschar almost died of joy on receiving it.  He blessed the
lady a thousand times, and, shutting up his shop where he had no longer
anything to do, he returned home.

He was still absorbed in contemplating his good fortune, when a knock
came to his door, and on opening it he found an old woman standing
outside.

"My son," she said, "I have a favour to ask of you.  It is the hour of
prayer and I have not yet washed myself.  Let me, I beg you, enter your
house, and give me water."

My brother, although the old woman was a stranger to him, did not
hesitate to do as she wished.  He gave her a vessel of water and then
went back to his place and his thoughts, and with his mind busy over
his last adventure, he put his gold into a long and narrow purse, which
he could easily carry in his belt.  During this time the old woman was
busy over her prayers, and when she had finished she came and
prostrated herself twice before my brother, and then rising called down
endless blessings on his head.  Observing her shabby clothes, my
brother thought that her gratitude was in reality a hint that he should
give her some money to buy some new ones, so he held out two pieces of
gold.  The old woman started back in surprise as if she had received an
insult.  "Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "what is the meaning of this?
Is it possible that you take me, my lord, for one of those miserable
creatures who force their way into houses to beg for alms?  Take back
your money.  I am thankful to say I do not need it, for I belong to a
beautiful lady who is very rich and gives me everything I want."

My brother was not clever enough to detect that the old woman had
merely refused the two pieces of money he had offered her in order to
get more, but he inquired if she could procure him the pleasure of
seeing this lady.

"Willingly," she replied; "and she will be charmed to marry you, and to
make you the master of all her wealth.  So pick up your money and
follow me."

Delighted at the thought that he had found so easily both a fortune and
a beautiful wife, my brother asked no more questions, but concealing
his purse, with the money the lady had given him, in the folds of his
dress, he set out joyfully with his guide.

They walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at a large
house, where she knocked.  The door was opened by a young Greek slave,
and the old woman led my brother across a well-paved court into a
well-furnished hall.  Here she left him to inform her mistress of his
presence, and as the day was hot he flung himself on a pile of cushions
and took off his heavy turban.  In a few minutes there entered a lady,
and my brother perceived at the first glance that she was even more
beautiful and more richly dressed than he had expected.  He rose from
his seat, but the lady signed to him to sit down again and placed
herself beside him.  After the usual compliments had passed between
them she said, "We are not comfortable here, let us go into another
room," and passing into a smaller chamber, apparently communicating
with no other, she continued to talk to him for some time.  Then rising
hastily she left him, saying, "Stay where you are, I will come back in
a moment."

He waited as he was told, but instead of the lady there entered a huge
black slave with a sword in his hand.  Approaching my brother with an
angry countenance he exclaimed, "What business have you here?" His
voice and manner were so terrific that Alnaschar had not strength to
reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from him, and even sabre cuts
to be inflicted on him without making any resistance.  As soon as he
was let go, he sank on the ground powerless to move, though he still
had possession of his senses.  Thinking he was dead, the black ordered
the Greek slave to bring him some salt, and between them they rubbed it
into his wounds, thus giving him acute agony, though he had the
presence of mind to give no sign of life.  They then left him, and
their place was taken by the old woman, who dragged him to a trapdoor
and threw him down into a vault filled with the bodies of murdered men.

At first the violence of his fall caused him to lose consciousness, but
luckily the salt which had been rubbed into his wounds had by its
smarting preserved his life, and little by little he regained his
strength.  At the end of two days he lifted the trapdoor during the
night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak, when he saw the
old woman leave the house in search of more prey.  Luckily she did not
observe him, and when she was out of sight he stole from this nest of
assassins and took refuge in my house.

I dressed his wounds and tended him carefully, and when a month had
passed he was as well as ever.  His one thought was how to be revenged
on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose he had a purse made large
enough to contain five hundred gold pieces, but filled it instead with
bits of glass.  This he tied round him with his sash, and, disguising
himself as an old woman, he took a sabre, which he hid under his dress.

One morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met his old enemy
prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy.  He went up to her
and, imitating the voice of a woman, he said, "Do you happen to have a
pair of scales you could lend me?  I have just come from Persia and
have brought with me five hundred gold pieces, and I am anxious to see
if they are the proper weight."

"Good woman," replied the old hag, "you could not have asked anyone
better.  My son is a money-changer, and if you will follow me he will
weigh them for you himself.  Only we must be quick or he will have gone
to his shop."  So saying she led the way to the same house as before,
and the door was opened by the same Greek slave.

Again my brother was left in the hall, and the pretended son appeared
under the form of the black slave.  "Miserable crone," he said to my
brother, "get up and come with me," and turned to lead the way to the
place of murder.  Alnaschar rose too, and drawing the sabre from under
his dress dealt the black such a blow on his neck that his head was
severed from his body.  My brother picked up the head with one hand,
and seizing the body with the other dragged it to the vault, when he
threw it in and sent the head after it.  The Greek slave, supposing
that all had passed as usual, shortly arrived with the basin of salt,
but when she beheld Alnaschar with the sabre in his hand she let the
basin fall and turned to fly.  My brother, however, was too quick for
her, and in another instant her head was rolling from her shoulders.
The noise brought the old woman running to see what was the matter, and
he seized her before she had time to escape.  "Wretch!" he cried, "do
you know me?"

There remained only the lady, who was quite ignorant of all that was
taking place around her.  He sought her through the house, and when at
last he found her, she nearly fainted with terror at the sight of him.
She begged hard for life, which he was generous enough to give her, but
he bade her to tell him how she had got into partnership with the
abominable creatures he had just put to death.

"I was once," replied she, "the wife of an honest merchant, and that
old woman, whose wickedness I did not know, used occasionally to visit
me.  ''Madam,'' she said to me one day, ''we have a grand wedding at our
house to-day. If you would do us the honour to be present, I am sure
you would enjoy yourself.''  I allowed myself to be persuaded, put on my
richest dress, and took a purse with a hundred pieces of gold.  Once
inside the doors I was kept by force by that dreadful black, and it is
now three years that I have been here, to my great grief."

"Such wealth," returned she, "that if you succeed in carrying it all
away it will make you rich for ever.  Come and let us see how much
there is."

She led Alnaschar into a chamber filled with coffers packed with gold,
which he gazed at with an admiration he was powerless to conceal.
"Go," she said, "and bring men to carry them away."

My brother did not wait to be told twice, and hurried out into the
streets, where he soon collected ten men.  They all came back to the
house, but what was his surprise to find the door open, and the room
with the chests of gold quite empty.  The lady had been cleverer than
himself, and had made the best use of her time.  However, he tried to
console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture, which more
than made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost.

Unluckily, on leaving the house, he forgot to lock the door, and the
neighbours, finding the place empty, informed the police, who next
morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief.  My brother tried to bribe them
to let him off, but far from listening to him they tied his hands, and
forced him to walk between them to the presence of the judge.  When
they had explained to the official the cause of complaint, he asked
Alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that he had taken to
his house the day before.

"Sir," replied Alnaschar, "I am ready to tell you the whole story, but
give, I pray you, your word, that I shall run no risk of punishment."

"That I promise," said the judge.  So my brother began at the beginning
and related all his adventures, and how he had avenged himself on those
who had betrayed him.  As to the furniture, he entreated the judge at
least to allow him to keep part to make up for the five hundred pieces
of gold which had been stolen from him.

The judge, however, would say nothing about this, and lost no time in
sending men to fetch away all that Alnaschar had taken from the house.
When everything had been moved and placed under his roof he ordered my
brother to leave the town and never more to enter it on peril of his
life, fearing that if he returned he might seek justice from the
Caliph.  Alnaschar obeyed, and was on his way to a neighbouring city
when he fell in with a band of robbers, who stripped him of his clothes
and left him naked by the roadside.  Hearing of his plight, I hurried
after him to console him for his misfortunes, and to dress him in my
best robe.  I then brought him back disguised, under cover of night, to
my house, where I have since given him all the care I bestow on my
other brothers.

There now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth
brother, whose name was Schacabac.  Like the rest of us, he inherited a
hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he thought was a large
fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it all, and was driven to
beg.  As he had a smooth tongue and good manners, he really did very
well in his new profession, and he devoted himself specially to making
friends with the servants in big houses, so as to gain access to their
masters.

One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of servants
lounging in the courtyard.  He thought that from the appearance of the
house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he entered and inquired to
whom it belonged.

"My good man, where do you come from?" replied the servant.  "Can''t you
see for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a Barmecide?" for the
Barmecides were famed for their liberality and generosity.  My brother,
hearing this, asked the porters, of whom there were several, if they
would give him alms.  They did not refuse, but told him politely to go
in, and speak to the master himself.

My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building,
which was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartments
of the Barmecide.  At last, in a room richly decorated with paintings,
he saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa, who
received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened to make
his petition.

"My lord," he said, "you behold in me a poor man who only lives by the
help of persons as rich and as generous as you."

Before he could proceed further, he was stopped by the astonishment
shown by the Barmecide.  "Is it possible," he cried, "that while I am
in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving?  That is a state of
things that must at once be put an end to!  Never shall it be said that
I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part, will never
abandon me."

"What, you are dying of hunger?" exclaimed the Barmecide.  "Here,
slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat!" No slave
appeared, but my brother remarked that the Barmecide did not fail to
rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them.

Then he said to my brother, "Why don''t you wash your hands too?" and
Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of the Barmecide
(though he could see none himself), drew near, and imitated his motion.

When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands, he raised his voice, and
cried, "Set food before us at once, we are very hungry." No food was
brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himself from a dish, and
carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so, "Eat, my friend, eat,
I entreat.  Help yourself as freely as if you were at home!  For a
starving man, you seem to have a very small appetite."

"Excuse me, my lord," replied Schacabac, imitating his gestures as
before, "I really am not losing time, and I do full justice to the
repast."

"Oh, my lord," answered my brother, who beheld neither meat nor bread,
"never have I tasted anything so delicious."

"Eat as much as you want," said the Barmecide.  "I bought the woman who
makes it for five hundred pieces of gold, so that I might never be
without it."

After ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be placed on
the table, and discussing the merits of each one, the Barmecide
declared that having dined so well, they would now proceed to take
their wine.  To this my brother at first objected, declaring that it
was forbidden; but on the Barmecide insisting that it was out of the
question that he should drink by himself, he consented to take a
little.  The Barmecide, however, pretended to fill their glasses so
often, that my brother feigned that the wine had gone into his head,
and struck the Barmecide such a blow on the head, that he fell to the
ground.  Indeed, he raised his hand to strike him a second time, when
the Barmecide cried out that he was mad, upon which my brother
controlled himself, and apologised and protested that it was all the
fault of the wine he had drunk.  At this the Barmecide, instead of
being angry, began to laugh, and embraced him heartily.  "I have long
been seeking," he exclaimed, "a man of your description, and henceforth
my house shall be yours.  You have had the good grace to fall in with
my humour, and to pretend to eat and to drink when nothing was there.
Now you shall be rewarded by a really good supper."

Then he clapped his hands, and all the dishes were brought that they
had tasted in imagination before and during the repast, slaves sang and
played on various instruments.  All the while Schacabac was treated by
the Barmecide as a familiar friend, and dressed in a garment out of his
own wardrobe.

Twenty years passed by, and my brother was still living with the
Barmecide, looking after his house, and managing his affairs.  At the
end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs, so all his
possessions went to the prince.  They even despoiled my brother of
those that rightly belonged to him, and he, now as poor as he had ever
been in his life, decided to cast in his lot with a caravan of pilgrims
who were on their way to Mecca.  Unluckily, the caravan was attacked
and pillaged by the Bedouins, and the pilgrims were taken prisoners.
My brother became the slave of a man who beat him daily, hoping to
drive him to offer a ransom, although, as Schacabac pointed out, it was
quite useless trouble, as his relations were as poor as himself.  At
length the Bedouin grew tired of tormenting, and sent him on a camel to
the top of a high barren mountain, where he left him to take his
chance.  A passing caravan, on its way to Bagdad, told me where he was
to be found, and I hurried to his rescue, and brought him in a
deplorable condition back to the town.

"This,"--continued the barber,--"is the tale I related to the Caliph,
who, when I had finished, burst into fits of laughter.

"Well were you called `the Silent,''" said he; "no name was ever better
deserved.  But for reasons of my own, which it is not necessary to
mention, I desire you to leave the town, and never to come back."

"I had of course no choice but to obey, and travelled about for several
years until I heard of the death of the Caliph, when I hastily returned
to Bagdad, only to find that all my brothers were dead.  It was at this
time that I rendered to the young cripple the important service of
which you have heard, and for which, as you know, he showed such
profound ingratitude, that he preferred rather to leave Bagdad than to
run the risk of seeing me.  I sought him long from place to place, but
it was only to-day, when I expected it least, that I came across him,
as much irritated with me as ever"--  So saying the tailor went on to
relate the story of the lame man and the barber, which has already been
told.

"When the barber," he continued, "had finished his tale, we came to the
conclusion that the young man had been right, when he had accused him
of being a great chatter-box. However, we wished to keep him with us,
and share our feast, and we remained at table till the hour of
afternoon prayer.  Then the company broke up, and I went back to work
in my shop.

"It was during this interval that the little hunchback, half drunk
already, presented himself before me, singing and playing on his drum.
I took him home, to amuse my wife, and she invited him to supper.
While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in spite of all
we could do, he died shortly.  It was all so sudden that we lost our
heads, and in order to divert suspicion from ourselves, we carried the
body to the house of a Jewish physician.  He placed it in the chamber
of the purveyor, and the purveyor propped it up in the street, where it
was thought to have been killed by the merchant.

"This, Sire, is the story which I was obliged to tell to satisfy your
highness.  It is now for you to say if we deserve mercy or punishment;
life or death?"

The Sultan of Kashgar listened with an air of pleasure which filled the
tailor and his friends with hope.  "I must confess," he exclaimed,
"that I am much more interested in the stories of the barber and his
brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my own jester.  But
before I allow you all four to return to your own homes, and have the
corpse of the hunchback properly buried, I should like to see this
barber who has earned your pardon.  And as he is in this town, let an
usher go with you at once in search of him."

The usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing with them an old man
who must have been at least ninety years of age.  "O Silent One," said
the Sultan, "I am told that you know many strange stories.  Will you
tell some of them to me?"

"Never mind my stories for the present," replied the barber, "but will
your Highness graciously be pleased to explain why this Jew, this
Christian, and this Mussulman, as well as this dead body, are all here?"

"What business is that of yours?" asked the Sultan with a smile; but
seeing that the barber had some reasons for his question, he commanded
that the tale of the hunchback should be told him.

"It is certainly most surprising," cried he, when he had heard it all,
"but I should like to examine the body."  He then knelt down, and took
the head on his knees, looking at it attentively.  Suddenly he burst
into such loud laughter that he fell right backwards, and when he had
recovered himself enough to speak, he turned to the Sultan.  "The man
is no more dead than I am," he said; "watch me."  As he spoke he drew a
small case of medicines from his pocket and rubbed the neck of the
hunchback with some ointment made of balsam.  Next he opened the dead
man''s mouth, and by the help of a pair of pincers drew the bone from
his throat.  At this the hunchback sneezed, stretched himself and
opened his eyes.

The Sultan and all those who saw this operation did not know which to
admire most, the constitution of the hunchback who had apparently been
dead for a whole night and most of one day, or the skill of the barber,
whom everyone now began to look upon as a great man.  His Highness
desired that the history of the hunchback should be written down, and
placed in the archives beside that of the barber, so that they might be
associated in people''s minds to the end of time.  And he did not stop
there; for in order to wipe out the memory of what they had undergone,
he commanded that the tailor, the doctor, the purveyor and the
merchant, should each be clothed in his presence with a robe from his
own wardrobe before they returned home.  As for the barber, he bestowed
on him a large pension, and kept him near his own person.

Some twenty days'' sail from the coast of Persia lies the isle of the
children of Khaledan.  The island is divided into several provinces, in
each of which are large flourishing towns, and the whole forms an
important kingdom.  It was governed in former days by a king named
Schahzaman, who, with good right, considered himself one of the most
peaceful, prosperous, and fortunate monarchs on the earth.  In fact, he
had but one grievance, which was that none of his four wives had given
him an heir.

This distressed him so greatly that one day he confided his grief to
the grand-vizir, who, being a wise counsellor, said:  "Such matters are
indeed beyond human aid.  Allah alone can grant your desire, and I
should advise you, sire, to send large gifts to those holy men who
spend their lives in prayer, and to beg for their intercessions.  Who
knows whether their petitions may not be answered!"

The king took his vizir''s advice, and the result of so many prayers for
an heir to the throne was that a son was born to him the following year.

Schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings to all the mosques and
religious houses, and great rejoicings were celebrated in honour of the
birth of the little prince, who was so beautiful that he was named
Camaralzaman, or "Moon of the Century."

Prince Camaralzaman was brought up with extreme care by an excellent
governor and all the cleverest teachers, and he did such credit to them
that when he was grown up, a more charming and accomplished young man
was not to be found.  Whilst he was still a youth the king, his father,
who loved him dearly, had some thoughts of abdicating in his favour.
As usual he talked over his plans with his grand-vizir, who, though he
did not approve the idea, would not state all his objections.

"Sire," he replied, "the prince is still very young for the cares of
state.  Your Majesty fears his growing idle and careless, and doubtless
you are right.  But how would it be if he were first to marry?  This
would attach him to his home, and your Majesty might give him a share
in your counsels, so that he might gradually learn how to wear a crown,
which you can give up to him whenever you find him capable of wearing
it."

The vizir''s advice once more struck the king as being good, and he sent
for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons, and standing
respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked for his commands.

"I have sent for you," said the king, "to say that I wish you to marry.
What do you think about it?"

The prince was so much overcome by these words that he remained silent
for some time.  At length he said:  "Sire, I beg you to pardon me if I
am unable to reply as you might wish.  I certainly did not expect such
a proposal as I am still so young, and I confess that the idea of
marrying is very distasteful to me.  Possibly I may not always be in
this mind, but I certainly feel that it will require some time to
induce me to take the step which your Majesty desires."

This answer greatly distressed the king, who was sincerely grieved by
his objection to marriage.  However he would not have recourse to
extreme measures, so he said:  "I do not wish to force you; I will give
you time to reflect, but remember that such a step is necessary, for a
prince such as you who will some day be called to rule over a great
kingdom."

From this time Prince Camaralzaman was admitted to the royal council,
and the king showed him every mark of favour.

At the end of a year the king took his son aside, and said: "Well, my
son, have you changed your mind on the subject of marriage, or do you
still refuse to obey my wish?"

The prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the former
occasion, and begged his father not to press the subject, adding that
it was quite useless to urge him any longer.

"I have followed your advice," he said; "but Camaralzaman declines to
marry, and is more obstinate than ever."

"Sire," replied the vizir, "much is gained by patience, and your
Majesty might regret any violence.  Why not wait another year and then
inform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council that the good
of the state demands his marriage?  He cannot possibly refuse again
before so distinguished an assemblage, and in our immediate presence."

The Sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once, but he
yielded to the vizir''s arguments and decided to wait.  He then visited
the prince''s mother, and after telling her of his disappointment and of
the further respite he had given his son, he added: "I know that
Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me.  Pray speak very
seriously to him on this subject, and make him realize that he will
most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate, and that he will
certainly regret the measures I shall be obliged to take to enforce my
will."

So the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son she told him she had
heard of his refusal to marry, adding how distressed she felt that he
should have vexed his father so much.  She asked what reasons he could
have for his objections to obey.

"Madam," replied the prince, "I make no doubt that there are as many
good, virtuous, sweet, and amiable women as there are others very much
the reverse.  Would that all were like you!  But what revolts me is the
idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all about her.  My
father will ask the hand of the daughter of some neighbouring
sovereign, who will give his consent to our union.  Be she fair or
frightful, clever or stupid, good or bad, I must marry her, and am left
no choice in the matter.  How am I to know that she will not be proud,
passionate, contemptuous, and recklessly extravagant, or that her
disposition will in any way suit mine?"

"But, my son," urged Fatima, "you surely do not wish to be the last of
a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom?"

"Madam," said the prince, "I have no wish to survive the king, my
father, but should I do so I will try to reign in such a manner as may
be considered worthy of my predecessors."

These and similar conversations proved to the Sultan how useless it was
to argue with his son, and the year elapsed without bringing any change
in the prince''s ideas.

At length a day came when the Sultan summoned him before the council,
and there informed him that not only his own wishes but the good of the
empire demanded his marriage, and desired him to give his answer before
the assembled ministers.

At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat that the
king, naturally irritated at being opposed by his son in full council,
ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an old tower, where
he had nothing but a very little furniture, a few books, and a single
slave to wait on him.

Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his books, showed himself
very indifferent to his sentence.

When night came he washed himself, performed his devotions, and, having
read some pages of the Koran, lay down on a couch, without putting out
the light near him, and was soon asleep.

Now there was a deep well in the tower in which Prince Camaralzaman was
imprisoned, and this well was a favourite resort of the fairy Maimoune,
daughter of Damriat, chief of a legion of genii.  Towards midnight
Maimoune floated lightly up from the well, intending, according to her
usual habit, to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident
might prompt.

The light in the prince''s room surprised her, and without disturbing
the slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered the room, and
approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied.

The prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet.  Maimoune
lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth she had ever
seen.

"What a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open!" she
thought.  "What can he have done to deserve to be treated like this?"

She could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but at length, having
softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replaced the coverlet and
resumed her flight through the air.

As she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great wings
coming towards her, and shortly met one of the race of bad genii.  This
genie, whose name was Danhasch, recognised Maimoune with terror, for he
knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him.  He would
gladly have avoided her altogether, but they were so near that he must
either be prepared to fight or yield to her, so he at once addressed
her in a conciliatory tone:

"Good Maimoune, swear to me by Allah to do me no harm, and on my side I
will promise not to injure you."

"Accursed genie!" replied Maimoune, "what harm can you do me?  But I
will grant your power and give the promise you ask.  And now tell me
what you have seen and done to-night."

"Fair lady," said Danhasch, "you meet me at the right moment to hear
something really interesting.  I must tell you that I come from the
furthest end of China, which is one of the largest and most powerful
kingdoms in the world.  The present king has one only daughter, who is
so perfectly lovely that neither you, nor I, nor any other creature
could find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms.
You must therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features,
joined to a brilliant and delicate complexion, and an enchanting
expression, and even then imagination will fall short of the reality.

"The king, her father, has carefully shielded this treasure from the
vulgar gaze, and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight
of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband.
But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her
seven palaces such as have never been seen before.  The first palace is
entirely composed of rock crystal, the second of bronze, the third of
fine steel, the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze,
the fifth of touchstone, the sixth of silver, and the seventh of solid
gold.  They are all most sumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens
surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste.  In fact, neither
trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the
princess.  The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide,
and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in
marriage.  The king has always received these embassies graciously, but
says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will,
and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys have had
to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were
gratified by their magnificent receptions."

"Sire," said the princess to her father, "you wish me to marry, and I
know you desire to please me, for which I am very grateful.  But,
indeed, I have no inclination to change my state, for where could I
find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful and delightful
surroundings?  I feel that I could never be as happy with any husband
as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on me."

"At last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that the King
of China felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter.  He told
her how important such an alliance would be, and pressed her to
consent.  In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that the princess at
length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due to her father.
"Sire," cried she angrily, "do not speak further of this or any other
marriage or I will plunge this dagger in my breast and so escape from
all these importunities."

"The king of China was extremely indignant with his daughter and
replied: "You have lost your senses and you must be treated
accordingly." So he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her
palaces, and only allowed her ten old women, of whom her nurse was the
head, to wait on her and keep her company.  He next sent letters to all
the kings who had sued for the princess''s hand, begging they would
think of her no longer, as she was quite insane, and he desired his
various envoys to make it known that anyone who could cure her should
have her to wife.

"Fair Maimoune," continued Danhasch, "this is the present state of
affairs.  I never pass a day without going to gaze on this incomparable
beauty, and I am sure that if you would only accompany me you would
think the sight well worth the trouble, and own that you never saw such
loveliness before."

The fairy only answered with a peal of laughter, and when at length she
had control of her voice she cried, "Oh, come, you are making game of
me!  I thought you had something really interesting to tell me instead
of raving about some unknown damsel.  What would you say if you could
see the prince I have just been looking at and whose beauty is really
transcendent?  That is something worth talking about, you would
certainly quite lose your head."

"Know," replied Maimoune, "that he is in much the same case as your
princess.  The king, his father, wanted to force him to marry, and on
the prince''s refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an old tower
where I have just seen him."

"I don''t like to contradict a lady," said Danhasch, "but you must
really permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my princess."

"Well, I don''t wish to seem obstinate," replied Danhasch, "the best
plan to test the truth of what I say will be for you to let me take you
to see the princess for yourself."

"There is no need for that," retorted Maimoune; "we can satisfy
ourselves in another way.  Bring your princess here and lay her down
beside my prince.  We can then compare them at leisure, and decide
which is in the right."

Danhasch readily consented, and after having the tower where the prince
was confined pointed out to him, and making a wager with Maimoune as to
the result of the comparison, he flew off to China to fetch the
princess.

In an incredibly short time Danhasch returned, bearing the sleeping
princess.  Maimoune led him to the prince''s room, and the rival beauty
was placed beside him.

When the prince and princess lay thus side by side, an animated dispute
as to their respective charms arose between the fairy and the genius.
Danhasch began by saying:

"Doubt!  Of course I do!" exclaimed Maimoune.  "Why, you must be blind
not to see how much my prince excels your princess.  I do not deny that
your princess is very handsome, but only look and you must own that I
am in the right."

"There is no need for me to look longer," said Danhasch, "my first
impression will remain the same; but of course, charming Maimoune, I am
ready to yield to you if you insist on it."

"By no means," replied Maimoune.  "I have no idea of being under any
obligation to an accursed genius like you.  I refer the matter to an
umpire, and shall expect you to submit to his verdict."

Danhasch readily agreed, and on Maimoune striking the floor with her
foot it opened, and a hideous, hump-backed, lame, squinting genius,
with six horns on his head, hands like claws, emerged.  As soon as he
beheld Maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked her commands.

"Rise, Caschcasch," said she.  "I summoned you to judge between me and
Danhasch.  Glance at that couch, and say without any partiality whether
you think the youth or the maiden lying there the more beautiful."

Caschcasch looked at the prince and princess with every token of
surprise and admiration.  At length, having gazed long without being
able to come to a decision, he said

"Madam, I must confess that I should deceive you were I to declare one
to be handsomer than the other.  There seems to me only one way in
which to decide the matter, and that is to wake one after the other and
judge which of them expresses the greater admiration for the other."

This advice pleased Maimoune and Danhasch, and the fairy at once
transformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling on
Camaralzaman''s throat stung him so sharply that he awoke.  As he did so
his eyes fell on the Princess of China.  Surprised at finding a lady so
near him, he raised himself on one arm to look at her.  The youth and
beauty of the princess at once awoke a feeling to which his heart had
as yet been a stranger, and he could not restrain his delight.

"What loveliness!  What charms!  Oh, my heart, my soul!" he exclaimed,
as he kissed her forehead, her eyes and mouth in a way which would
certainly have roused her had not the genie''s enchantments kept her
asleep.

"How, fair lady!" he cried, "you do not wake at the signs of
Camaralzaman''s love?  Be you who you may, he is not unworthy of you."

It then suddenly occurred to him, that perhaps this was the bride his
father had destined for him, and that the King had probably had her
placed in this room in order to see how far Camaralzaman''s aversion to
marriage would withstand her charms.

So saying he drew off a fine ring which the princess wore on her
finger, and replaced it by one of his own.  After which he lay down
again and was soon fast asleep.

She started up, and was not a little amazed at seeing a young man
beside her.  From surprise she soon passed to admiration, and then to
delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he was.

"Why," cried she, "was it you my father wished me to marry?  How
unlucky that I did not know sooner!  I should not have made him so
angry.  But wake up! wake up! for I know I shall love you with all my
heart."

So saying she shook Camaralzaman so violently that nothing but the
spells of Maimoune could have prevented his waking.

"Oh!" cried the princess.  "Why are you so drowsy?"  So saying she took
his hand and noticed her own ring on his finger, which made her wonder
still more.  But as he still remained in a profound slumber she pressed
a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep too.

Then Maimoune turning to the genie said:  "Well, are you satisfied that
my prince surpasses your princess?  Another time pray believe me when I
assert anything."

Then turning to Caschcasch:  "My thanks to you, and now do you and
Danhasch bear the princess back to her own home."

On waking next morning the first thing Prince Camaralzaman did was to
look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night, and the next to
question the slave who waited on him about her.  But the slave
persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady, and still less
of how she got into the tower, that the prince lost all patience, and
after giving him a good beating tied a rope round him and ducked him in
the well till the unfortunate man cried out that he would tell
everything.  Then the prince drew him up all dripping wet, but the
slave begged leave to change his clothes first, and as soon as the
prince consented hurried off just as he was to the palace.  Here he
found the king talking to the grand-vizir of all the anxiety his son
had caused him.  The slave was admitted at once and cried:

"Alas, Sire!  I bring sad news to your Majesty.  There can be no doubt
that the prince has completely lost his senses.  He declares that he
saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night, and the state you see me
in proves how violent contradiction makes him." He then gave a minute
account of all the prince had said and done.

The king, much moved, begged the vizir to examine into this new
misfortune, and the latter at once went to the tower, where he found
the prince quietly reading a book.  After the first exchange of
greetings the vizir said:

"Most likely," said the prince; "but now that you are here I am glad of
the opportunity to ask you where is the lady who slept in this room
last night?"

"Prince!" he exclaimed, "how would it be possible for any man, much
less a woman, to enter this room at night without walking over your
slave on the threshold?  Pray consider the matter, and you will realise
that you have been deeply impressed by some dream."

But the prince angrily insisted on knowing who and where the lady was,
and was not to be persuaded by all the vizir''s protestations to the
contrary that the plot had not been one of his making.  At last, losing
patience, he seized the vizir by the beard and loaded him with blows.

"I confess, Prince," said the vizir, "that there is some foundation for
what you say.  But you know well that a minister has to carry out his
master''s orders.  Allow me to go and to take to the king any message
you may choose to send."

"Very well," said the prince; "then go and tell him that I consent to
marry the lady whom he sent or brought here last night.  Be quick and
bring me back his answer."

He then gave an exact account of his interview with Camaralzaman and of
the prince''s fury when told that it was not possible for any lady to
have entered his room, and of the treatment he himself had received.
The king, much distressed, determined to clear up the matter himself,
and, ordering the vizir to follow him, set out to visit his son.

The prince received his father with profound respect, and the king,
making him sit beside him, asked him several questions, to which
Camaralzaman replied with much good sense.  At last the king said: "My
son, pray tell me about the lady who, it is said, was in your room last
night."

"Sire," replied the prince, "pray do not increase my distress in this
matter, but rather make me happy by giving her to me in marriage.
However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly, the sight of
this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices, and I will gratefully
receive her from your hands."

The king was almost speechless on hearing his son, but after a time
assured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever about the lady
in question, and had not connived at her appearance.  He then desired
the prince to relate the whole story to him.

Camaralzaman did so at great length, showed the ring, and implored his
father to help to find the bride he so ardently desired.

"After all you tell me," remarked the king, "I can no longer doubt your
word; but how and whence the lady came, or why she should have stayed
so short a time I cannot imagine.  The whole affair is indeed
mysterious.  Come, my dear son, let us wait together for happier days."

So saying the king took Camaralzaman by the hand and led him back to
the palace, where the prince took to his bed and gave himself up to
despair, and the king shutting himself up with his son entirely
neglected the affairs of state.

The prime minister, who was the only person admitted, felt it his duty
at last to tell the king how much the court and all the people
complained of his seclusion, and how bad it was for the nation.  He
urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely little island
close by, whence he could easily attend public audiences, and where the
charming scenery and fine air would do the invalid so much good as to
enable him to bear his father''s occasional absence.

The king approved the plan, and as soon as the castle on the island
could be prepared for their reception he and the prince arrived there,
Schahzaman never leaving his son except for the prescribed public
audiences twice a week.

Whilst all this was happening in the capital of Schahzaman the two
genii had carefully borne the Princess of China back to her own palace
and replaced her in bed.  On waking next morning she first turned from
one side to another and then, finding herself alone, called loudly for
her women.

"Why," continued the princess, "the most charming and beautiful young
man lay sleeping beside me last night.  I did my utmost to wake him,
but in vain."

"But, Princess," expostulated the nurse, "we left you quite alone last
night, and we have seen no one enter your room since then."

At this the princess lost all patience, and taking the nurse by her
hair she boxed her ears soundly, crying out:  "You shall tell me, you
old witch, or I''ll kill you."

The nurse had no little trouble in escaping, and hurried off to the
queen, to whom she related the whole story with tears in her eyes.

"You see, madam," she concluded, "that the princess must be out of her
mind.  If only you will come and see her, you will be able to judge for
yourself."

The queen hurried to her daughter''s apartments, and after tenderly
embracing her, asked her why she had treated her nurse so badly.

"Madam," said the princess, "I perceive that your Majesty wishes to
make game of me, but I can assure you that I will never marry anyone
except the charming young man whom I saw last night.  You must know
where he is, so pray send for him."

The queen was much surprised by these words, but when she declared that
she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess lost all respect,
and answered that if she were not allowed to marry as she wished she
should kill herself, and it was in vain that the queen tried to pacify
her and bring her to reason.

The king himself came to hear the rights of the matter, but the
princess only persisted in her story, and as a proof showed the ring on
her finger.  The king hardly knew what to make of it all, but ended by
thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever, and without
further argument he had her placed in still closer confinement, with
only her nurse to wait on her and a powerful guard to keep the door.

Then he assembled his council, and having told them the sad state of
things, added:  "If any of you can succeed in curing the princess, I
will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my heir."

An elderly emir present, fired with the desire to possess a young and
lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to try the magic
arts with which he was acquainted.

"You are welcome to try," said the king, "but I make one condition,
which is, that should you fail you will lose your life."

The emir accepted the condition, and the king led him to the princess,
who, veiling her face, remarked, "I am surprised, sire, that you should
bring an unknown man into my presence."

"Sire," replied the princess, "this is not the one you gave me before
and whose ring I wear.  Permit me to say that I can accept no other."

The emir, who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense, finding
how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that he could not
venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at his Majesty''s
disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptly had it cut off.

This was the first of many suitors for the princess whose inability to
cure her cost them their lives.

Now it happened that after things had been going on in this way for
some time the nurse''s son Marzavan returned from his travels.  He had
been in many countries and learnt many things, including astrology.
Needless to say that one of the first things his mother told him was
the sad condition of the princess, his foster-sister. Marzavan asked if
she could not manage to let him see the princess without the king''s
knowledge.

After some consideration his mother consented, and even persuaded the
eunuch on guard to make no objection to Marzavan''s entering the royal
apartment.

The princess was delighted to see her foster-brother again, and after
some conversation she confided to him all her history and the cause of
her imprisonment.

Marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the utmost attention.  When
she had finished speaking he said,

"If what you tell me, Princess, is indeed the case, I do not despair of
finding comfort for you.  Take patience yet a little longer.  I will
set out at once to explore other countries, and when you hear of my
return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off." So saying, he
took his leave and started next morning on his travels.

Marzavan journeyed from city to city and from one island and province
to another, and wherever he went he heard people talk of the strange
story of the Princess Badoura, as the Princess of China was named.

After four months he reached a large populous seaport town named Torf,
and here he heard no more of the Princess Badoura but a great deal of
Prince Camaralzaman, who was reported ill, and whose story sounded very
similar to that of the Princess Badoura.

Marzavan was rejoiced, and set out at once for Prince Camaralzaman''s
residence.  The ship on which he embarked had a prosperous voyage till
she got within sight of the capital of King Schahzaman, but when just
about to enter the harbour she suddenly struck on a rock, and foundered
within sight of the palace where the prince was living with his father
and the grand-vizir.

Marzavan, who swam well, threw himself into the sea and managed to land
close to the palace, where he was kindly received, and after having a
change of clothing given him was brought before the grand-vizir. The
vizir was at once attracted by the young man''s superior air and
intelligent conversation, and perceiving that he had gained much
experience in the course of his travels, he said, "Ah, how I wish you
had learnt some secret which might enable you to cure a malady which
has plunged this court into affliction for some time past!"

Marzavan replied that if he knew what the illness was he might possibly
be able to suggest a remedy, on which the vizir related to him the
whole history of Prince Camaralzaman.

On hearing this Marzavan rejoiced inwardly, for he felt sure that he
had at last discovered the object of the Princess Badoura''s
infatuation.  However, he said nothing, but begged to be allowed to see
the prince.

On entering the royal apartment the first thing which struck him was
the prince himself, who lay stretched out on his bed with his eyes
closed.  The king sat near him, but, without paying any regard to his
presence, Marzavan exclaimed, "Heavens! what a striking likeness!"
And, indeed, there was a good deal of resemblance between the features
of Camaralzaman and those of the Princess of China.

These words caused the prince to open his eyes with languid curiosity,
and Marzavan seized this moment to pay him his compliments, contriving
at the same time to express the condition of the Princess of China in
terms unintelligible, indeed, to the Sultan and his vizir, but which
left the prince in no doubt that his visitor could give him some
welcome information.

The prince begged his father to allow him the favour of a private
interview with Marzavan, and the king was only too pleased to find his
son taking an interest in anyone or anything.  As soon as they were
left alone Marzavan told the prince the story of the Princess Badoura
and her sufferings, adding, "I am convinced that you alone can cure
her; but before starting on so long a journey you must be well and
strong, so do your best to recover as quickly as may be."

These words produced a great effect on the prince, who was so much
cheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt able to get up
and be dressed.  The king was overjoyed at the result of Marzavan''s
interview, and ordered public rejoicings in honour of the prince''s
recovery.

Before long the prince was quite restored to his original state of
health, and as soon as he felt himself really strong he took Marzavan
aside and said:

"Now is the time to perform your promise.  I am so impatient to see my
beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall fall ill again if we
do not start soon.  The one obstacle is my father''s tender care of me,
for, as you may have noticed, he cannot bear me out of his sight."

"Prince," replied Marzavan, "I have already thought over the matter,
and this is what seems to me the best plan.  You have not been out of
doors since my arrival.  Ask the king''s permission to go with me for
two or three days'' hunting, and when he has given leave order two good
horses to be held ready for each of us.  Leave all the rest to me."

Next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making his
request, and the king gladly granted it on condition that only one
night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after such a
long illness.

Next morning Prince Camaralzaman and Marzavan were off betimes,
attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses.  They hunted a
little by the way, but took care to get as far from the towns as
possible.  At night-fall they reached an inn, where they supped and
slept till midnight.  Then Marzavan awoke and roused the prince without
disturbing anyone else.  He begged the prince to give him the coat he
had been wearing and to put on another which they had brought with
them.  They mounted their second horses, and Marzavan led one of the
grooms'' horses by the bridle.

By daybreak our travellers found themselves where four cross roads met
in the middle of the forest.  Here Marzavan begged the prince to wait
for him, and leading the groom''s horse into a dense part of the wood he
cut its throat, dipped the prince''s coat in its blood, and having
rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground where the roads parted.

In answer to Camaralzaman''s inquiries as to the reason for this,
Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their
journey was to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince''s
death.  "Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief,"
he went on, "but his joy at your return will be all the greater."

The prince and his companion now continued their journey by land and
sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray their expenses
they met with no needless delays.  At length they reached the capital
of China, where they spent three days in a suitable lodging to recover
from their fatigues.

During this time Marzavan had an astrologer''s dress prepared for the
prince.  They then went to the baths, after which the prince put on the
astrologer''s robe and was conducted within sight of the king''s palace
by Marzavan, who left him there and went to consult his mother, the
princess''s nurse.

Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan''s instructions, advanced
close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud:

"I am an astrologer and I come to restore health to the Princess
Badoura, daughter of the high and mighty King of China, on the
conditions laid down by His Majesty of marrying her should I succeed,
or of losing my life if I fail."

It was some little time since anyone had presented himself to run the
terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the princess, and a crowd
soon gathered round the prince.  On perceiving his youth, good looks,
and distinguished bearing, everyone felt pity for him.

"What are you thinking of, sir," exclaimed some; "why expose yourself
to certain death?  Are not the heads you see exposed on the town wall
sufficient warning?  For mercy''s sake give up this mad idea and retire
whilst you can."

But the prince remained firm, and only repeated his cry with greater
assurance, to the horror of the crowd.

Camaralzaman now called out for the third time, and at last the
grand-vizir himself came out and fetched him in.

The prime minister led the prince to the king, who was much struck by
the noble air of this new adventurer, and felt such pity for the fate
so evidently in store for him, that he tried to persuade the young man
to renounce his project.

But Camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted in his intentions, and
at length the king desired the eunuch who had the guard of the
princess''s apartments to conduct the astrologer to her presence.

The eunuch led the way through long passages, and Camaralzaman followed
rapidly, in haste to reach the object of his desires.  At last they
came to a large hall which was the ante-room to the princess''s chamber,
and here Camaralzaman said to the eunuch:

"Now you shall choose.  Shall I cure the princess in her own presence,
or shall I do it from here without seeing her?"

The eunuch, who had expressed many contemptuous doubts as they came
along of the newcomer''s powers, was much surprised and said:

"Very well," replied the prince:  "then, impatient though I am to see
the princess, I will effect the cure where I stand, the better to
convince you of my power."  He accordingly drew out his writing case
and wrote as follows--"Adorable princess!  The enamoured Camaralzaman
has never forgotten the moment when, contemplating your sleeping
beauty, he gave you his heart.  As he was at that time deprived of the
happiness of conversing with you, he ventured to give you his ring as a
token of his love, and to take yours in exchange, which he now encloses
in this letter.  Should you deign to return it to him he will be the
happiest of mortals, if not he will cheerfully resign himself to death,
seeing he does so for love of you.  He awaits your reply in your
ante-room."

Having finished this note the prince carefully enclosed the ring in it
without letting the eunuch see it, and gave him the letter, saying:

"Take this to your mistress, my friend, and if on reading it and seeing
its contents she is not instantly cured, you may call me an impudent
impostor."

"Madam, a new astrologer has arrived, who declares that you will be
cured as soon as you have read this letter and seen what it contains."

The princess took the note and opened it with languid indifference.
But no sooner did she see her ring than, barely glancing at the
writing, she rose hastily and with one bound reached the doorway and
pushed back the hangings.  Here she and the prince recognised each
other, and in a moment they were locked in each other''s arms, where
they tenderly embraced, wondering how they came to meet at last after
so long a separation.  The nurse, who had hastened after her charge,
drew them back to the inner room, where the princess restored her ring
to Camaralzaman.

"Take it back," she said, "I could not keep it without returning yours
to you, and I am resolved to wear that as long as I live."

Meantime the eunuch had hastened back to the king.  "Sire," he cried,
"all the former doctors and astrologers were mere quacks.  This man has
cured the princess without even seeing her." He then told all to the
king, who, overjoyed, hastened to his daughter''s apartments, where,
after embracing her, he placed her hand in that of the prince, saying:

"Happy stranger, I keep my promise, and give you my daughter to wife,
be you who you may.  But, if I am not much mistaken, your condition is
above what you appear to be."

The prince thanked the king in the warmest and most respectful terms,
and added:  "As regards my person, your Majesty has rightly guessed
that I am not an astrologer.  It is but a disguise which I assumed in
order to merit your illustrious alliance.  I am myself a prince, my
name is Camaralzaman, and my father is Schahzaman, King of the Isles of
the Children of Khaledan."  He then told his whole history, including
the extraordinary manner of his first seeing and loving the Princess
Badoura.

When he had finished the king exclaimed:  "So remarkable a story must
not be lost to posterity.  It shall be inscribed in the archives of my
kingdom and published everywhere abroad."

The wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and rejoicings.
Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative post at court,
with a promise of further advancement.

The prince and princess were now entirely happy, and months slipped by
unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other''s society.

One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt that he saw his father
lying at the point of death, and saying:  "Alas! my son whom I loved so
tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my death."

The princess said but little at the time, but next morning she went to
the king, and kissing his hand said:

"I have a favour to ask of your Majesty, and I beg you to believe that
it is in no way prompted by my husband.  It is that you will allow us
both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman."

Sorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his daughter, he
felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not refuse it, and
made but one condition, which was that she should only spend one year
at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting that in future the young
couple should visit their respective parents alternately.

The princess brought this good news to her husband, who thanked her
tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection.

All preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards, and when
all was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some days, after
which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter, and charging the
prince to take every care of her, returned to his capital.

The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the end of a month reached
a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which cast a most
pleasant shade.  As the heat was great, Camaralzaman thought it well to
encamp in this cool spot.  Accordingly the tents were pitched, and the
princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving his further orders,
removed her girdle, which she placed beside her, and desiring her women
to leave her, lay down and was soon asleep.

When the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and, seeing
the princess asleep, he sat down near her without speaking.  His eyes
fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst inspecting the
precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewn to the girdle
and fastened by a loop.  He touched it and felt something hard within.
Curious as to what this might be, he opened the pouch and found a
cornelian engraved with various figures and strange characters.

"This cornelian must be something very precious," thought he, "or my
wife would not wear it on her person with so much care."

In truth it was a talisman which the Queen of China had given her
daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as long as she
carried it about her.

The better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the open doorway
of the tent.  As he stood there holding it in the open palm of his
hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stone up in its beak and
flew away with it.

The bird having secured its prey flew off some yards and alighted on
the ground, holding the talisman it its beak.  Prince Camaralzaman
advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but as soon as he approached
the thief fluttered on a little further still.  He continued his
pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone and took a longer
flight than before.  The prince then hoped to kill it with a stone, but
the more hotly he pursued the further flew the bird.

In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the entire day,
and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on the top of a very
high tree where it could rest in safety.

The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think whether
he had better return to the camp.  "But," thought he, "how shall I find
my way back?  Must I go up hill or down?  I should certainly lose my
way in the dark, even if my strength held out."  Overwhelmed by hunger,
thirst, fatigue and sleep, he ended by spending the night at the foot
of the tree.

Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch, and
no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again with as little
success as the previous day, only stopping to eat some herbs and fruit
he found by the way.  In this fashion he spent ten days, following the
bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree, whilst it
roosted on the topmost bough.  On the eleventh day the bird and the
prince reached a large town, and as soon as they were close to its
walls the bird took a sudden and higher flight and was shortly
completely out of sight, whilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having
to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of the Princess
Badoura.

Much cast down, he entered the town, which was built near the sea and
had a fine harbour.  He walked about the streets for a long time, not
knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the seashore he
found a garden door open and walked in.

The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look up,
and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a Mussulman,
he told him to come in at once and to shut the door.

"Because," said the gardener, "I see that you are a stranger and a
Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters, who
hate and persecute all of our faith.  It seems almost a miracle that
has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that you have found a
place of safety."

Camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter,
and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted him with:

"Leave compliments alone.  You are weary and must be hungry.  Come in,
eat, and rest."  So saying he led the prince into his cottage, and
after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of his arrival.

Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by inquiring the
shortest way to his father''s capital.  "For," added he, "if I tried to
rejoin the princess, how should I find her after eleven days''
separation.  Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive!" At this
terrible thought he burst into tears.

The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they were quite a year''s land
journey to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a much shorter
route by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of the Children
of Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship sailed once a year
for the Ebony Island by which he might get so far as his very home.

"If only you had arrived a few days sooner," he said, "you might have
embarked at once.  As it is you must now wait till next year, but if
you care to stay with me I offer you my house, such as it is, with all
my heart."

Prince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of refuge,
and gladly accepted the gardener''s offer.  He spent his days working in
the garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for his beloved wife.

On first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince near her.
She called her women and asked if they knew where he was, and whilst
they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent, but had
not noticed his leaving it, she took up her belt and perceived that the
little pouch was open and the talisman gone.

She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly
bring it back.  She waited for him till evening rather impatiently, and
wondering what could have kept him from her so long.  When night came
without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker
roundly.  In spite of her grief and anxiety however, she did not lose
her presence of mind, but decided on a courageous, though very unusual
step.

Only the princess and her women knew of Camaralzaman''s disappearance,
for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting in their tents.
Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she ordered her women
not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion, and proceeded
to change her dress for one of her husband''s, to whom, as has been
already said, she bore a strong likeness.

In this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she gave
orders next morning to break up the camp and continue the journey no
one suspected the change.  She made one of her women enter her litter,
whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began.

After a protracted journey by land and sea the princess, still under
the name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at the capital of
the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos.

No sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in port had on
board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurried to meet the
supposed prince, and had him and his retinue brought to the palace,
where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously.

After three days, finding that his guest, to whom he had taken a great
fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos said to him:

"Prince, I am now an old man, and unfortunately I have no son to whom
to leave my kingdom.  It has pleased Heaven to give me only one
daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charm that I could only
give her to a prince as highly born and as accomplished as yourself.
Instead, therefore, of returning to your own country, take my daughter
and my crown and stay with us.  I shall feel that I have a worthy
successor, and shall cheerfully retire from the fatigues of government."

The king''s offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the Princess
Badoura.  She felt that it was equally impossible to confess that she
had deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his
heart; a refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and
persecution.

All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few moments
silence said with a blush, which the king attributed to modesty:

"Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinion your Majesty
has expressed for my person and of the honour you do me, that, though I
am quite unworthy of it, I dare not refuse.  But, sire, I can only
accept such an alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with
your counsels."

The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for the
following day, and the princess employed the intervening time in
informing the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring them
that the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage.
She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret well.

King Armanos, delighted with the success of his plans, lost no time in
assembling his court and council, to whom he presented his successor,
and placing his future son-in-law on the throne made everyone do homage
and take oaths of allegiance to the new king.

At night the whole town was filled with rejoicings, and with much pomp
the Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the king''s daughter)
was conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura.

Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first interview
with King Armanos'' daughter, and she felt the only thing to do was at
once to take her into her confidence.

"Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myself on your
mercy.  I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess like yourself and
his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story, then I am sure you will
forgive my imposture, in consideration of my sufferings."

She then related her whole history, and at its close Haiatelnefous
embraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire sympathy and
affection.

The two princesses now planned out their future action, and agreed to
combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura continue to play a
man''s part until such time as there might be news of the real
Camaralzaman.

Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony Island Prince
Camaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage in the
town of the idolaters.

"To-day is a public holiday, and the people of the town not only do not
work themselves but forbid others to do so.  You had better therefore
take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and as the time is
near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you I will make
inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for you." He then put
on his best clothes and went out, leaving the prince, who strolled into
the garden and was soon lost in thoughts of his dear wife and their sad
separation.

As he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his reverie by
the noise two large birds were making in a tree.

Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw that the birds were
fighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one fell
dead to the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew
away.  Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been watching
the duel, flew up and alighted, one at the head and the other at the
feet of the dead bird.  They stood there some time sadly shaking their
heads, and then dug up a grave with their claws in which they buried
him.

As soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off, and ere long
returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they held, one by a
wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming and struggling
with rage and terror.  But they held tight, and having brought him to
his victim''s grave, they proceeded to kill him, after which they tore
open his body, scattered the inside and once more flew away.

The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest, now
drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the dead bird he
noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its
inside.  He picked it up, and what was his surprise when he recognised
the Princess Badoura''s talisman which had been the cause of many
misfortunes.  It would be impossible to describe his joy; he kissed the
talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and carefully tied it round his
arm.  For the first time since his separation from the princess he had
a good night, and next morning he was up at day-break and went
cheerfully to ask what work he should do.

The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had quite
died away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously.  As he
was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard.  On
pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze, under
which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps.  He went down them and
found himself in a roomy kind of cave in which stood fifty large bronze
jars, each with a cover on it.  The prince uncovered one after another,
and found them all filled with gold dust.  Delighted with his discovery
he left the cave, replaced the slab, and having finished cutting down
the tree waited for the gardener''s return.

The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which he
was inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not being yet
known he had been told to return next day for further information.  He
had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good news beaming in
his face.

"My son," said he, "rejoice and hold yourself ready to start in three
days'' time.  The ship is to set sail, and I have arranged all about
your passage with the captain.

"You could not bring me better news," replied Camaralzaman, "and in
return I have something pleasant to tell you.  Follow me and see the
good fortune which has befallen you."

He then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him the treasure
stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven should in this
way reward his kind host''s many virtues and compensate him for the
privations of many years.

"What do you mean?" asked the gardener.  "Do you imagine that I should
appropriate this treasure?  It is yours, and I have no right whatever
to it.  For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground here without
discovering anything.  It is clear that these riches are intended for
you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself than by an
old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing.  This treasure
comes just at the right time, when you are about to return to your own
country, where you will make good use of it."

But the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finally after
much discussion they agreed to divide the gold.  When this was done the
gardener said:

"My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off
this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it.  There are
no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported from here fetch a
high price.  As you know, I have a good stock of the olives which grew
in this garden.  Now you must take fifty jars, fill each half full of
gold dust and fill them up with the olives.  We will then have them
taken on board ship when you embark."

The prince took this advice, and spent the rest of the day filling the
fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip from his
arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of putting it in one of
the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it.
When night came the jars were all ready, and the prince and his host
went to bed.

Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and
excitement of the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener passed
a very bad night.  He was worse next day, and by the morning of the
third day was dangerously ill.  At daybreak the ship''s captain and some
of his sailors knocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger
who was to embark.

"I am he," said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door.  "The gardener
who took my passage is ill and cannot see you, but please come in and
take these jars of olives and my bag, and I will follow as soon as I
have taken leave of him."

The sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving charged
Camaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he wished to
set sail at once.

As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage to bid
farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more for all his
kindness.  But the old man was at his last gasp, and had barely
murmured his confession of faith when he expired.

Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices, so
having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man up and
buried him.  He then locked the door, gave up the key to the owner of
the garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the ship had
sailed long ago, after waiting three hours for him.

It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh
misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and
distasteful country.  Moreover, he had once more lost the Princess
Badoura''s talisman, which he feared he might never see again.  There
was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had
done, and to live on in the cottage.  As he could not well cultivate
the garden by himself, he engaged a lad to help him, and to secure the
rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more
jars, filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for
transport.

Whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toil and
privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safely at the Ebony
Island.

As the palace of the new king, or rather of the Princess Badoura,
overlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and asked what
vessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and was told that
it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which yearly brought
rich merchandise.

The princess, ever on the look out for any chance of news of her
beloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by some officers of
the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing.  She sent for
him and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what passengers
he had, and what his vessel was laden with.  The captain answered all
her questions, and said that his passengers consisted entirely of
traders who brought rich stuffs from various countries, fine muslins,
precious stones, musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives, and many other
things.

"I will take all you have on board.  Have them unloaded and we will
make our bargain at once, and tell the other merchants to let me see
all their best wares before showing them to other people."

"Sire," replied the captain, "I have on board fifty very large pots of
olives.  They belong to a merchant who was left behind, as in spite of
waiting for him he delayed so long that I was obliged to set sail
without him."

The captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it soon
returned laden with the fifty pots of olives.  The princess asked what
they might be worth.

"Sire," replied the captain, "the merchant is very poor.  Your Majesty
will not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of silver."

"In order to satisfy him and as he is so poor," said the princess, "I
will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you, which you will be
sure to remit to him."

So saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the palace,
having the jars carried before her.  When evening came the Princess
Badoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going to the
apartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty jars of
olives brought to her.  She opened one to let her friend taste the
olives and to taste them herself, but great was her surprise when, on
pouring some into a dish, she found them all powdered with gold dust.
"What an adventure! how extraordinary!" she cried.  Then she had the
other jars opened, and was more and more surprised to find the olives
in each jar mixed with gold dust.

But when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the jars her
emotion was so great that she fainted away.  The Princess Haiatelnefous
and her women hastened to restore her, and as soon as she recovered
consciousness she covered the precious talisman with kisses.

"You will have guessed, my dear, that it was the sight of this talisman
which has moved me so deeply.  This was the cause of my separation from
my dear husband, and now, I am convinced, it will be the means of our
reunion."

As soon as it was light next day the Princess Badoura sent for the
captain, and made further inquiries about the merchant who owned the
olive jars she had bought.

In reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where the young
man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he came to be left
behind.

"If that is the case," said the princess, "you must set sail at once
and go back for him.  He is a debtor of mine and must be brought here
at once, or I will confiscate all your merchandise.  I shall now give
orders to have all the warehouses where your cargo is placed under the
royal seal, and they will only be opened when you have brought me the
man I ask for.  Go at once and obey my orders."

The captain had no choice but to do as he was bid, so hastily
provisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage.

When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of the Island of
Idolaters, he judged it better not to enter the harbour, but casting
anchor at some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with six
active sailors and landed near Camaralzaman''s cottage.

The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake moaning over all the sad
events which had separated him from his wife, he thought he heard a
knock at the garden door.  He went to open it, and was immediately
seized by the captain and sailors, who without a word of explanation
forcibly bore him off to the boat, which took them back to the ship
without loss of time.  No sooner were they on board than they weighed
anchor and set sail.

Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then, now asked the captain
(whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction.

"Well, you must know better than I," said the captain.  "You will soon
see him now, and meantime be content where you are and have patience."

The return voyage was as prosperous as the former one, and though it
was night when the ship entered the harbour, the captain lost no time
in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to the palace, where
he begged an audience with the king.

Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she recognised him in
spite of his shabby clothes.  She longed to throw herself on his neck,
but restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both that she
should play her part a little longer.  She therefore desired one of her
officers to take care of him and to treat him well.  Next she ordered
another officer to remove the seals from the warehouse, whilst she
presented the captain with a costly diamond, and told him to keep the
thousand pieces of gold paid for the olives, as she would arrange
matters with the merchant himself.

She then returned to her private apartments, where she told the
Princess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her plans for
the future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily
promised.

Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath and clothed
in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province.  He was then
introduced to the council, where his good looks and grand air drew the
attention of all on him.

Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking himself once more,
turned to the other emirs, saying:

"My lords, I introduce to you a new colleague, Camaralzaman, whom I
have known on my travels and who, I can assure you, you will find well
deserves your regard and admiration."

Camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the king--whom he never
suspected of being a woman in disguise--asserting their acquaintance,
for he felt sure he had never seen her before.  However he received all
the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty, and prostrating
himself, said:

"Sire, I cannot find words in which to thank your Majesty for the great
honour conferred on me.  I can but assure you that I will do all in my
power to prove myself worthy of it."

On leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid house
which had been prepared for him, where he found a full establishment
and well-filled stables at his orders.  On entering his study his
steward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for his
current expenses.  He felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune,
and little guessed that the Princess of China was the cause of it.

After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted Camaralzaman to the post
of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so much integrity
and benevolence as to win universal esteem.

He would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it not been
for that separation which he never ceased to bewail.  He had no clue to
the mystery of his present position, for the princess, out of
compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and was generally known
as King Armanos the younger, few people remembering that on her first
arrival she went by another name.

At length the princess felt that the time had come to put an end to her
own and the prince''s suspense, and having arranged all her plans with
the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzaman that she wished
his advice on some important business, and, to avoid being disturbed,
desired him to come to the palace that evening.

The prince was punctual, and was received in the private apartment,
when, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the princess took from
a small box the talisman, and, handing it to Camaralzaman, said:  "Not
long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman.  As you are universally
well informed, you can perhaps tell me what is its use."

Camaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it to the light, cried with
surprise, "Sire, you ask me the use of this talisman.  Alas! hitherto
it has been only a source of misfortune to me, being the cause of my
separation from the one I love best on earth.  The story is so sad and
strange that I am sure your Majesty will be touched by it if you will
permit me to tell it you."

"I will hear it some other time," replied the princess.  "Meanwhile I
fancy it is not quite unknown to me.  Wait here for me.  I will return
shortly."

So saying she retired to another room, where she hastily changed her
masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting on the girdle
she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman.

The prince recognised her at once, and, embracing her with the utmost
tenderness, cried, "Ah, how can I thank the king for this delightful
surprise?"

"Do not expect ever to see the king again," said the princess, as she
wiped the tears of joy from her eyes, "in me you see the king.  Let us
sit down, and I will tell you all about it."

She then gave a full account of all her adventures since their parting,
and dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of the Princess
Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she owed so much.  When she
had done she asked to hear the prince''s story, and in this manner they
spent most of the night.

Next morning the princess resumed her woman''s clothes, and as soon as
she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King Armanos to come
to her apartments.

When the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a strange lady
in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual right to enter the
private apartment.  Seating himself he asked for the king.

"Sire," said the princess, "yesterday I was the king, to-day I am only
the Princess of China and wife to the real Prince Camaralzaman, son of
King Schahzaman, and I trust that when your Majesty shall have heard
our story you will not condemn the innocent deception I have been
obliged to practise."

At the close of her narrative the princess said, "Sire, as our religion
allows a man to have more than one wife, I would beg your Majesty to
give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in marriage to Prince
Camaralzaman.  I gladly yield to her the precedence and title of Queen
in recognition of the debt of gratitude which I owe her."

King Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration, then,
turning to Camaralzaman, he said, "My son, as your wife, the Princess
Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law), consents to
share your hand and affections with my daughter, I have only to ask if
this marriage is agreeable to you, and if you will consent to accept
the crown which the Princess Badoura deserves to wear all her life, but
which she prefers to resign for love of you."

Accordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king, and as duly married
with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with whose beauty,
talents, and affections he had every reason to be pleased.

The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together, and after a
time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose births were
celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing.

Balsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph.
During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of Balsora,
who was his cousin, was called Zinebi.  Not thinking one vizir enough
for the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacan and
Saouy.

Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasure in obliging,
as far as in him lay, those who had business with him.  Throughout the
entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem and praise him as he
deserved.

Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone with whom
he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite of his great
riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the necessaries of life.
What made him particularly detested was the great aversion he had to
Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king.

One day, while the king amused himself talking with his two vizirs and
other members of the council, the conversation turned on female slaves.
While some declared that it sufficed for a slave to be beautiful,
others, and Khacan was among the number, maintained that beauty alone
was not enough, but that it must be accompanied by wit, wisdom,
modesty, and, if possible, knowledge.

The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but charged
Khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions.
Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of the honour
done to Khacan, said, "Sire, it will be very difficult to find a slave
as accomplished as your Majesty desires, and, if she is to be found,
she will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces."

"Saouy," answered the king, "you seem to find that a very great sum.
For you it may be so, but not for me."

And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present, to send
10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the slave.

As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent for the dealers in
female slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a one as
he described to inform him.  They promised to do their utmost, and no
day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection but none
was found without some defect.

At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to the king''s
palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced eagerly that a
Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening, had a slave to
sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty.

Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave should be
brought for his inspection on his return from the palace.  The dealer
appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave beautiful
beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the name of "The Fair
Persian."

Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the short
conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain another slave
to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king, and
therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her.

"Sir," was the answer, "for less than 10,000 gold pieces he will not
let her go; he declares that, what with masters for her instruction,
and for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing and nourishment, he
has already spent that sum upon her.  She is in every way fit to be the
slave of a king; she plays every musical instrument, she sings, she
dances, she makes verses, in fact there is no accomplishment in which
she does not excel."

Khacan, who was better able to judge of her merits than the dealer,
wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for the merchant, and
said to him, "It is not for myself that I wish to buy your slave, but
for the king.  Her price, however, is too high."

"Sir," replied the merchant, "I should esteem it an honour to present
her to his Majesty, did it become a merchant to do such a thing.  I ask
no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such as she is."

Khacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had the sum counted out,
and given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said:

"Sir, as she is destined for the king, I would have you observe that
she is extremely tired with the long journey, and before presenting her
to his Majesty you would do well to keep her a fortnight in your own
house, and to see that a little care is bestowed upon her.  The sun has
tanned her complexion, but when she has been two or three times to the
bath, and is fittingly dressed, you will see how much her beauty will
be increased."

Khacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and determined to follow
it.  He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to that of his
wife, whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for the
king, and to order for her the most magnificent garments.

Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he said to her: "No happiness
can be greater than what I have procured for you; judge for yourself,
you now belong to the king.  I have, however, to warn you of one thing.
I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense, is young, foolish, and
headstrong, and I charge you to keep him at a distance."

Noureddin--for so the vizir''s son was named--went freely in and out of
his mother''s apartments.  He was young, well-made and agreeable, and
had the gift of charming all with whom he came in contact.  As soon as
he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that she was destined for
the king, he let himself be carried away by her charms, and determined
at once to use every means in his power to retain her for himself.  The
Persian was equally captivated by Noureddin, and said to herself:  "The
vizir does me too great honour in buying me for the king.  I should
esteem myself very happy if he would give me to his son."

Noureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her beauty,
to talk and laugh with her, and never would have left her side if his
mother had not forced him.

Some time having elapsed, on account of the long journey, since the
beautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days after her
purchase the vizir''s wife gave orders that the bath should be heated
for her, and that her own female slaves should attend her there, and
after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that had been
prepared for her.

Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came to present herself to
the vizir''s wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly was her beauty
increased.  Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave said: "Madam, I do
not know how you find me in this dress that you have had prepared for
me; your women assure me that it suits me so well that they hardly knew
me.  If it is the truth they tell me, and not flattery, it is to you I
owe the transformation."

"My daughter," answered the vizir''s wife, "they do not flatter you.  I
myself hardly recognised you.  The improvement is not due to the dress
alone, but largely to the beautifying effects of the bath.  I am so
struck by its results, that I would try it on myself."

Acting forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slaves during
her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and not to allow
Noureddin to enter should he come.

She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not finding his mother in
her apartment, would have sought her in that of the Persian.  The two
little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his mother had given
orders that he was not to be admitted.  Taking each by an arm, he put
them out of the anteroom, and shut the door.  Then they rushed to the
bath, informing their mistress with shrieks and tears that Noureddin
had driven them away by force and gone in.

This news caused great consternation to the lady, who, dressing herself
as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment of the fair Persian,
to find that Noureddin had already gone out.  Much astonished to see
the vizir''s wife enter in tears, the Persian asked what misfortune had
happened.

"What!" exclaimed the lady, "you ask me that, knowing that my son
Noureddin has been alone with you?"

"Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to tell me that his father has
changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him.  I believed him, and so
great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willingly pass my life
with him."

"Would to heaven," exclaimed the wife of the vizir, "that what you say
were true; but Noureddin has deceived you, and his father will
sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done."

Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much astonished to find his
wife and her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian greatly
perturbed.  He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was
forthcoming.  When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform
him of what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no bounds.
Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:

"Wretched son! thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father.  The
king will shed not only thy blood but mine."  His wife tried to console
him, saying:  "Do not torment thyself.  With the sale of my jewels I
will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you will buy another
slave."

"Do not suppose," replied her husband, "that it is the loss of the
money that affects me.  My honour is at stake, and that is more
precious to me than all my wealth.  You know that Saouy is my mortal
enemy.  He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the
consequences that will ensue."

"My lord," said his wife, "I am quite aware of Saouy''s baseness, and
that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick.  But how can he
or any one else know what takes place in this house?  Even if you are
suspected and the king accuses you, you have only to say that, after
examining the slave, you did not find her worthy of his Majesty.
Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers, saying that you are not
satisfied, and wish them to find you another slave."

This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it, but his
wrath against his son did not abate.  Noureddin dared not appear all
that day, and fearing to take refuge with his usual associates in case
his father should seek him there, he spent the day in a secluded garden
where he was not known.  He did not return home till after his father
had gone to bed, and went out early next morning before the vizir
awoke, and these precautions he kept up during an entire month.

His mother, though knowing very well that he returned to the house
every evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him.  At length she
took courage and said:

"My lord, I know that a son could not act more basely towards his
father than Noureddin has done towards you, but after all will you now
pardon him?  Do you not consider the harm you may be doing yourself,
and fear that malicious people, seeking the cause of your estrangement,
may guess the real one?"

"Madam," replied the vizir, "what you say is very just, but I cannot
pardon Noureddin before I have mortified him as he deserves."

"He will be sufficiently punished," answered the lady, "if you do as I
suggest.  In the evening, when he returns home, lie in wait for him and
pretend that you will slay him.  I will come to his aid, and while
pointing out that you only yield his life at my supplications, you can
force him to take the beautiful Persian on any conditions you please."
Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and everything took place as
arranged.  On Noureddin''s return Khacan pretended to be about to slay
him, but yielding to his wife''s intercession, said to his son:

"You owe your life to your mother.  I pardon you on her intercession,
and on the conditions that you take the beautiful Persian for your
wife, and not your slave, that you never sell her, nor put her away."

Noureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence, thanked his father, and
vowed to do as he desired.  Khacan was at great pains frequently to
speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission he had
given him, but some whispers of what had actually taken place did reach
Saouy''s ears.

More than a year after these events the minister took a chill, leaving
the bath while still heated to go out on important business.  This
resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly increased.  The
vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for Noureddin, and
charged him with his dying breath never to part with the beautiful
Persian.

Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal regret throughout the
kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the grave.  Noureddin
showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father''s death, and for
long refused to see any one.  At length a day came when, one of his
friends being admitted, urged him strongly to be consoled, and to
resume his former place in society.  This advice Noureddin was not slow
to follow, and soon he formed little society of ten young men all about
his own age, with whom he spent all his time in continual feasting and
merry-making.

Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear at these festivities,
but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and did not scruple to
warn Noureddin of the probable consequences.  He, however, only laughed
at her advice, saying, that his father had always kept him in too great
constraint, and that now he rejoiced at his new-found liberty.

What added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refused to look
into his accounts with his steward, sending him away every time he
appeared with his book.

Not only did Noureddin''s friends constantly partake of his hospitality,
but in every way they took advantage of his generosity; everything of
his that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or any other source
of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them.  In vain the Persian
protested against the wrong he did himself; he continued to scatter
with the same lavish hand.

Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse himself, and
dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire.  The
year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table, there came
a knock at the door.  The slaves having been sent away, Noureddin went
to open it himself.  One of his friends had risen at the same time, but
Noureddin was before him, and finding the intruder to be the steward,
he went out and closed the door.  The friend, curious to hear what
passed between them, hid himself behind the hangings, and heard the
following words:

"My lord," said the steward, "I beg a thousand pardons for interrupting
you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place.  Nothing remains of
the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all other sources of income
are also at end, having been transferred by you to others.  If you wish
me to remain in your service, furnish me with the necessary funds, else
I must withdraw."

The friend, who had been listening behind the curtain, immediately
hastened to communicate the news to the rest of the company.

Noureddin re-entering at that moment, they plainly saw, in spite of his
efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was the truth.  One by
one they rose, and each with a different excuse left the room, till
presently he found himself alone, though little suspecting the
resolution his friends had taken.  Then, seeing the beautiful Persian,
he confided to her the statement of the steward, with many expressions
of regret for his own carelessness.

"Had I but followed your advice, beautiful Persian," he said, "all this
would not have happened, but at least I have this consolation, that I
have spent my fortune in the company of friends who will not desert me
in an hour of need.  To-morrow I will go to them, and amongst them they
will lend me a sum sufficient to start in some business."

Accordingly next morning early Noureddin went to seek his ten friends,
who all lived in the same street.  Knocking at the door of the first
and chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall while he
announced his visit to his master.  "Noureddin!" he heard him exclaim
quite audibly.  "Tell him, every time he calls, that I am not at home."
The same thing happened at the second door, and also at the third, and
so on with all the ten.  Noureddin, much mortified, recognised too late
that he had confided in false friends, who abandoned him in his hour of
need.  Overwhelmed with grief, he sought consolation from the beautiful
Persian.

"Alas, my lord," she said, "at last you are convinced of the truth of
what I foretold.  There is now no other resource left but to sell your
slaves and your furniture."

First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the
proceeds, after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was
valuable it sufficed for some time.  Finally this resource also came to
an end, and again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian.

"My lord," she said, "I know that the late vizir, your father, bought
me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminished in value since,
I should still fetch a large sum.  Do not therefore hesitate to sell
me, and with the money you obtain go and establish yourself in business
in some distant town."

"Charming Persian," answered Noureddin, "how could I be guilty of such
baseness?  I would die rather than part from you whom I love better
than my life."

"My lord," she replied, "I am well aware of your love for me, which is
only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessity obliges us to seek
the only remedy."

Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words, yielded, and
reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing her to a dealer
named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her value.

Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan exclaimed as soon as she had
unveiled, "My lord, is not this the slave your father bought for 10,000
pieces?"

On learning that it was so, he promised to obtain the highest possible
price for her.  Leaving the beautiful Persian shut up in the room
alone, he went out to seek the slave merchants, announcing to them that
he had found the pearl among slaves, and asking them to come and put a
value upon her.  As soon as they saw her they agreed that less than
4,000 gold pieces could not be asked.  Hagi Hassan, then closing the
door upon her, began to offer her for sale--calling out: "Who will bid
4,000 gold pieces for the Persian slave?"

Before any of the merchants had bid, Saouy happened to pass that way,
and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty, rode up to
Hagi Hassan and desired to see her.  Now it was not the custom to show
a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to disobey the vizir
his request was granted.

As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so struck by her beauty, that
he immediately wished to possess her, and not knowing that she belonged
to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the owner and to
conclude the bargain at once.

Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him that his slave was
going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her he was capable
of not paying the money.  "What you must do," he said, "is to pretend
that you had no real intention of selling your slave, and only swore
you would in a fit of anger against her.  When I present her to Saouy
as if with your consent you must step in, and with blows begin to lead
her away."

Noureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the great wrath of Saouy, who
riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful Persian from
him by force.  Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy''s horse by the
bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the bystanders, dragged him
to the ground, beat him severely, and left him in the gutter streaming
with blood.  Then, taking the beautiful Persian, he returned home
amidst the acclamations of the people, who detested Saouy so much that
they would neither interfere in his behalf nor allow his slaves to
protect him.

Covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he rose,
and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace, where he
demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related what had taken
place in these words:

"May it please your Majesty, I had gone to the slave market to buy
myself a cook.  While there I heard a slave being offered for 4,000
pieces.  Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable beauty, and
was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late vizir, to whom your
Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000 gold pieces for the
purchase of a slave.  This is the identical slave, whom instead of
bringing to your Majesty he gave to his own son.  Since the death of
his father this Noureddin has run through his entire fortune, has sold
all his possessions, and is now reduced to selling the slave.  Calling
him to me, I said:  "Noureddin, I will give you 10,000 gold pieces for
your slave, whom I will present to the king.  I will interest him at
the same time in your behalf, and this will be worth much more to you
than what extra money you might obtain from the merchants."  "Bad old
man," he exclaimed, "rather than sell my slave to you I would give her
to a Jew." "But, Noureddin," I remonstrated, "you do not consider that
in speaking thus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed
everything." This remonstrance only irritated him the more.  Throwing
himself on me like a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his
heart''s content, and left me in the state your Majesty sees."

The king''s wrath was kindled against Noureddin.  He ordered the captain
of the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage Noureddin''s house,
to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him.
A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan''s, hearing
this order given, slipped out of the king''s apartment, and hastened to
warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the beautiful Persian.
Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces, he disappeared before
Noureddin had time to thank him.

As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil they fled
together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town without being
observed.  At the mouth of the Euphrates they found a ship just about
to start for Bagdad.  They embarked, and immediately the anchor was
raised and they set sail.

When the captain of the guard reached Noureddin''s house he caused his
soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force, but no trace was
to be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the neighbours give
any information about them.  When the king heard that they had escaped,
he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would be
given to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that, on
the contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished.  Meanwhile
Noureddin and the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad.  When the
vessel had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces for their
passage and went ashore.  Never having been in Bagdad before, they did
not know where to seek a lodging.  Wandering along the banks of the
Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall.  The gate was
shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa on either
side.  "Here," said Noureddin, "let us pass the night," and reclining
on the sofas they soon fell asleep.

Now this garden belonged to the Caliph.  In the middle of it was a vast
pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each window having a
lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there.  Only the
door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim, who had
strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted, and never to allow
any one to sit on the sofas by the door.  It happened that evening that
he had gone out on an errand.  When he came back and saw two persons
asleep on the sofas he was about to drive them out with blows, but
drawing nearer he perceived that they were a handsome young man and
beautiful young woman, and decided to awake them by gentler means.
Noureddin, on being awoke, told the old man that they were strangers,
and merely wished to pass the night there.  "Come with me," said Scheih
Ibrahim, "I will lodge you better, and will show you a magnificent
garden belonging to me." So saying the doorkeeper led the way into the
Caliph''s garden, the beauties of which filled them with wonder and
amazement.  Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to
Scheih Ibrahim said,

"I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together."
Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to spend only the
tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself.  While he was
gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through the gardens and went up
the white marble staircase of the pavilion as far as the locked door of
the saloon.  On the return of Scheih Ibrahim they begged him to open
it, and to allow them to enter and admire the magnificence within.
Consenting, he brought not only the key, but a light, and immediately
unlocked the door.  Noureddin and the Persian entering, were dazzled
with the magnificence they beheld.  The paintings and furniture were of
astonishing beauty, and between each window was a silver arm holding a
candle.

Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and all three ate
together.  When they had finished eating Noureddin asked the old man to
bring them a bottle of wine.

"Heaven forbid," said Scheih Ibrahim, "that I should come in contact
with wine!  I who have four times made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and
have renounced wine for ever."

"You would, however, do us a great service in procuring us some," said
Noureddin.  "You need not touch it yourself.  Take the ass which is
tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest wine-shop, and ask some
passer-by to order two jars of wine; have them put in the ass''s
panniers, and drive him before you.  Here are two pieces of gold for
the expenses."

At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to execute the
commission.  On his return, Noureddin said:  "We have still need of
cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us some." Scheih
Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table spread with
cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful fruit.  Then he
withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to remain.

Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the wine excellent, drank
of it freely, and while drinking they sang.  Both had fine voices, and
Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure--first from a
distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put his head in at the door.
Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to come in and keep them company.
At first the old man declined, but was persuaded to enter the room, to
sit down on the edge of the sofa nearest the door, and at last to draw
closer and to seat himself by the beautiful Persian, who urged him so
persistently to drink her health that at length he yielded, and took
the cup she offered.

Now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine; he frequented
wine-shops like other people, and had taken none of the precautions
Noureddin had proposed.  Having once yielded, he was easily persuaded
to take a second cup, and a third, and so on till he no longer knew
what he was doing.  Till near midnight they continued drinking,
laughing, and singing together.

About that time the Persian, perceiving that the room was lit by only
one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to light some of the
beautiful candles in the silver arms.

"Light them yourself," answered the old man; "you are younger than I,
but let five or six be enough."

She did not stop, however, till she had lit all the eighty, but Scheih
Ibrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after that, Noureddin
proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he answered:

The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that moment to open a window
in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden, was surprised to see
the pavilion brilliantly illuminated.  Calling the grand-vizir, Giafar,
he said to him:

When the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph said, he trembled with
fear, and immediately invented an excuse.

"Commander of the Faithful," he said, "I must tell you that four or
five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he wished to have an assembly
of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permission to hold it in the
pavilion.  I granted his request, but forgot since to mention it to
your Majesty."

"Giafar," replied the Caliph, "you have committed three faults--first,
in giving the permission; second, in not mentioning it to me; and
third, in not investigating the matter more closely.  For punishment I
condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me in company of these
worthy people.  While I dress myself as a citizen, go and disguise
yourself, and then come with me."

When they reached the garden gate they found it open, to the great
indignation of the Caliph.  The door of the pavilion being also open,
he went softly upstairs, and looked in at the half-closed door of the
saloon.  Great was his surprise to see Scheih Ibrahim, whose sobriety
he had never doubted, drinking and singing with a young man and a
beautiful lady.  The Caliph, before giving way to his anger, determined
to watch and see who the people were and what they did.

Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful Persian if anything were
wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening.

Scheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cup-board and gave it to
the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the while with such skill
and taste that the Caliph was enchanted.  When she ceased he went
softly downstairs and said to the vizir:

"Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the lute better played.  I am
determined to go in and make her play to me."

"Commander of the Faithful," said the vizir, "if Scheih Ibrahim
recognises you he will die of fright."

"I should be sorry for that," answered the Caliph, "and I am going to
take steps to prevent it.  Wait here till I return."

Now the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake in his
garden.  There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be found, but
fishing was strictly forbidden.  It happened that night, however, that
a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being open to go in and
cast his nets.  He was just about to draw them when he saw the Caliph
approaching.  Recognising him at once in spite of his disguise, he
threw himself at his feet imploring forgiveness.

The fisherman did as he was told, and produced five or six fine fish,
of which the Caliph took the two largest.  Then he desired the
fisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the Caliph
was transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the turban.
Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir, who, not
recognising him, would have sent him about his business.  Leaving the
vizir at the foot of the stairs, the Caliph went up and knocked at the
door of the saloon.  Noureddin opened it, and the Caliph, standing on
the threshold, said:

"Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim.  Seeing that you are feasting
with your friends, I bring you these fish."

Noureddin and the Persian said that when the fishes were properly
cooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them.  The Caliph then
returned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih Ibrahim''s house
to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a dish that Noureddin
and the fair Persian ate of it with great relish.  When they had
finished Noureddin took thirty gold pieces (all that remained of what
Sangiar had given him) and presented them to the Caliph, who, thanking
him, asked as a further favour if the lady would play him one piece on
the lute.  The Persian gladly consented, and sang and played so as to
delight the Caliph.

Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others whatever they admired,
said, "Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take her; she is yours."

The fair Persian, astounded that he should wish to part from her, took
her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches to its music.

The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman) said to him, "Sir, I
perceive that this fair lady is your slave.  Oblige me, I beg you, by
relating your history."

Noureddin willingly granted this request, and recounted everything from
the purchase of the slave down to the present moment.

"Then, if you will listen to me," said the Caliph, "you will
immediately return to Balsora.  I will give you a letter to the king,
which will ensure you a good reception from him."

"It is an unheard-of thing," said Noureddin, "that a fisherman should
be in correspondence with a king."

"Let not that astonish you," answered the Caliph; "we studied together,
and have always remained the best of friends, though fortune, while
making him a king, left me a humble fisherman."

The Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following letter,
at the top of which he put in very small characters this formula to
show that he must be implicitly obeyed:--"In the name of the Most
Merciful God.

"Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends this letter to Mohammed Zinebi,
his cousin.  As soon as Noureddin, son of the Vizir Khacan, bearer of
this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read it, take off thy
royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat him in thy place
without fail.  Farewell."

The Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin, who immediately set off,
with only what little money he possessed when Sangiar came to his
assistance.  The beautiful Persian, inconsolable at his departure, sank
on a sofa bathed in tears.

When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih Ibrahim, who had hitherto kept
silence, said:  "Kerim, for two miserable fish thou hast received a
purse and a slave.  I tell thee I will take the slave, and as to the
purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece, if gold then I
will take all and give thee what copper pieces I have in my purse."

Now here it must be related that when the Caliph went upstairs with the
plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palace and bring
back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who should wait outside
the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his hands.

Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph answered: "Scheih Ibrahim,
whatever is in the purse I will share equally with you, but as to the
slave I will keep her for myself.  If you do not agree to these
conditions you shall have nothing."

The old man, furious at this insolence as he considered it, took a cup
and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a missile from the hand
of a drunken man.  It hit against the wall, and broke into a thousand
pieces.  Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged, then went out to fetch a
stick.  The Caliph at that moment clapped his hands, and the vizir and
the four slaves entering took off the fisherman''s dress and put on him
that which they had brought.

When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in his hand, the Caliph was
seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the fisherman but his
clothes in the middle of the room.  Throwing himself on the ground at
the Caliph''s feet, he said:  "Commander of the Faithful, your miserable
slave has offended you, and craves forgiveness."

The Caliph came down from his throne, and said:  "Rise, I forgive
thee." Then turning to the Persian he said:  "Fair lady, now you know
who I am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin to Balsora to be king,
and as soon as all necessary preparations are made I will send you
there to be queen.  Meanwhile I will give you an apartment in my
palace, where you will be treated with all honour."

At this the beautiful Persian took courage, and the Caliph was as good
as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife Zobeida.

Noureddin made all haste on his journey to Balsora, and on his arrival
there went straight to the palace of the king, of whom he demanded an
audience.  It was immediately granted, and holding the letter high
above his head he forced his way through the crowd.  While the king
read the letter he changed colour.  He would instantly have executed
the Caliph''s order, but first he showed the letter to Saouy, whose
interests were equally at stake with his own.  Pretending that he
wished to read it a second time, Saouy turned aside as if to seek a
better light; unperceived by anyone he tore off the formula from the
top of the letter, put it to his mouth, and swallowed it.  Then,
turning to the king, he said:

"Your majesty has no need to obey this letter.  The writing is indeed
that of the Caliph, but the formula is absent.  Besides, he has not
sent an express with the patent, without which the letter is useless.
Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences."

The king not only listened to the persuasions of Saouy, but gave
Noureddin into his hands.  Such a severe bastinado was first
administered to him, that he was left more dead than alive; then Saouy
threw him into the darkest and deepest dungeon, and fed him only on
bread and water.  After ten days Saouy determined to put an end to
Noureddin''s life, but dared not without the king''s authority.  To gain
this end, he loaded several of his own slaves with rich gifts, and
presented himself at their head to the king, saying that they were from
the new king on his coronation.

"Sire," said Saouy, "I thank your Majesty for the justice you do me.  I
would further beg, as Noureddin publicly affronted me, that the
execution might be in front of the palace, and that it might be
proclaimed throughout the city, so that no one may be ignorant of it."

The king granted these requests, and the announcement caused universal
grief, for the memory of Noureddin''s father was still fresh in the
hearts of his people.  Saouy, accompanied by twenty of his own slaves,
went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he mounted on a wretched
horse without a saddle.  Arrived at the palace, Saouy went in to the
king, leaving Noureddin in the square, hemmed in not only by Saouy''s
slaves but by the royal guard, who had great difficulty in preventing
the people from rushing in and rescuing Noureddin.  So great was the
indignation against Saouy that if anyone had set the example he would
have been stoned on his way through the streets.  Saouy, who witnessed
the agitation of the people from the windows of the king''s privy
chambers, called to the executioner to strike at once.  The king,
however, ordered him to delay; not only was he jealous of Saouy''s
interference, but he had another reason.  A troop of horsemen was seen
at that moment riding at full gallop towards the square.  Saouy
suspected who they might be, and urged the king to give the signal for
the execution without delay, but this the king refused to do till he
knew who the horsemen were.

Now, they were the vizir Giafar and his suite arriving at full speed
from Bagdad.  For several days after Noureddin''s departure with the
letter the Caliph had forgotten to send the express with the patent,
without which the letter was useless.  Hearing a beautiful voice one
day in the women''s part of the palace uttering lamentations, he was
informed that it was the voice of the fair Persian, and suddenly
calling to mind the patent, he sent for Giafar, and ordered him to make
for Balsora with the utmost speed--if Noureddin were dead, to hang
Saouy; if he were still alive, to bring him at once to Bagdad along
with the king and Saouy.

Giafar rode at full speed through the square, and alighted at the steps
of the palace, where the king came to greet him.  The vizir''s first
question was whether Noureddin were still alive.  The king replied that
he was, and he was immediately led forth, though bound hand and foot.
By the vizir''s orders his bonds were immediately undone, and Saouy was
tied with the same cords.  Next day Giafar returned to Bagdad, bearing
with him the king, Saouy, and Noureddin.

When the Caliph heard what treatment Noureddin had received, he
authorised him to behead Saouy with his own hands, but he declined to
shed the blood of his enemy, who was forthwith handed over to the
executioner.  The Caliph also desired Noureddin to reign over Balsora,
but this, too, he declined, saying that after what had passed there he
preferred never to return, but to enter the service of the Caliph.  He
became one of his most intimate courtiers, and lived long in great
happiness with the fair Persian.  As to the king, the Caliph contented
himself with sending him back to Balsora, with the recommendation to be
more careful in future in the choice of his vizir.

There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a
careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the
streets with little idle boys like himself.  This so grieved the father
that he died; yet, in spite of his mother''s tears and prayers, Aladdin
did not mend his ways.  One day, when he was playing in the streets as
usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he were not the son of
Mustapha the tailor.

On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his
neck and kissed him, saying:  "I am your uncle, and knew you from your
likeness to my brother.  Go to your mother and tell her I am coming."

However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came
laden with wine and fruit.  He presently fell down and kissed the place
where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin''s mother not to be
surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out
of the country.  He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at
which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears.  On
learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to
take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise.  Next day he bought
Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took him all over the city, showing
him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who
was overjoyed to see her son so fine.

Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long
way outside the city gates.  They sat down by a fountain, and the
magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them.
They then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains.
Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician
beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself.

"We will go no farther," said the false uncle.  "I will show you
something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a
fire."

When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him, at
the same time saying some magical words.  The earth trembled a little
and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a
brass ring in the middle to raise it by.  Aladdin tried to run away,
but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down.

"What have I done, uncle?" he said piteously; whereupon the magician
said more kindly:  "Fear nothing, but obey me.  Beneath this stone lies
a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you
must do exactly as I tell you."

At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as
he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather.  The stone
came up quite easily and some steps appeared.

"Go down," said the magician; "at the foot of those steps you will find
an open door leading into three large halls.  Tuck up your gown and go
through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly.
These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees.  Walk on till you
come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp.  Pour out the
oil it contains and bring it to me."

Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit
off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the
cave.  The magician cried out in a great hurry:

"Make haste and give me the lamp."  This Aladdin refused to do until he
was out of the cave.  The magician flew into a terrible passion, and
throwing some more powder on the fire, he said something, and the stone
rolled back into its place.

The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no
uncle of Aladdin''s, but a cunning magician who had read in his magic
books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man
in the world.  Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only
receive it from the hand of another.  He had picked out the foolish
Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him
afterwards.

For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting.  At
last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring,
which the magician had forgotten to take from him.  Immediately an
enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying:

Aladdin fearlessly replied:  "Deliver me from this place!" whereupon
the earth opened, and he found himself outside.  As soon as his eyes
could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold.  When
he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her
the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were in
reality precious stones.  He then asked for some food.

"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I have spun
a little cotton and will go and sell it."

Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead.
As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher
price.  Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would
have.  She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:

The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing
rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine.  Aladdin''s
mother, when she came to herself, said:

So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his
mother about the lamp.  She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to
do with devils.

"No," said Aladdin, "since chance has made us aware of its virtues, we
will use it and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my
finger."  When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold
one of the silver plates, and so on till none were left.  He then had
recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus
they lived for many years.

One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone
was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess, his
daughter, went to and from the bath.  Aladdin was seized by a desire to
see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled.  He
hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink.
The princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful
that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight.  He went home so
changed that his mother was frightened.  He told her he loved the
princess so deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask
her in marriage of her father.  His mother, on hearing this, burst out
laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the
Sultan and carry his request.  She fetched a napkin and laid in it the
magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like
the most beautiful jewels.  She took these with her to please the
Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp.  The grand-vizir and the
lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed
herself in front of the Sultan.  He, however, took no notice of her.
She went every day for a week, and stood in the same place.

When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to his
vizir:  "I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber every day
carrying something in a napkin.  Call her next time, that I may find
out what she wants."

Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot of the
throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: "Rise, good
woman, and tell me what you want."

She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir, and bade her
speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she
might say.  She then told him of her son''s violent love for the
princess.

"I prayed him to forget her," she said, "but in vain; he threatened to
do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the
hand of the princess.  Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my
son Aladdin."

The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she
unfolded the jewels and presented them.

He was thunderstruck, and turning to the vizir said:  "What sayest
thou?  Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such
a price?"

The vizir, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to
withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son
would contrive to make him a richer present.  The Sultan granted this,
and told Aladdin''s mother that, though he consented to the marriage,
she must not appear before him again for three months.

Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had
elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found everyone
rejoicing, and asked what was going on.

"Do you not know," was the answer, "that the son of the grand-vizir is
to marry the Sultan''s daughter to-night?"

Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was overwhelmed at first, but
presently bethought him of the lamp.  He rubbed it, and the genie
appeared, saying:  "What is thy will?"

Aladdin replied:  "The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his promise
to me, and the vizir''s son is to have the princess.  My command is that
to-night you bring hither the bride and bridegroom."

Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough at midnight the
genie transported the bed containing the vizir''s son and the princess.

"Fear nothing," Aladdin said to her; "you are my wife, promised to me
by your unjust father, and no harm shall come to you."

The princess was too frightened to speak, and passed the most miserable
night of her life, while Aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly.
At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom,
laid him in his place, and transported the bed back to the palace.

Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning.  The
unhappy vizir''s son jumped up and hid himself, while the princess would
not say a word, and was very sorrowful.

The Sultan sent her mother to her, who said:  "How comes it, child,
that you will not speak to your father?  What has happened?"

The princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother how, during the
night, the bed had been carried into some strange house, and what had
passed there.  Her mother did not believe her in the least, but bade
her rise and consider it an idle dream.

The following night exactly the same thing happened, and next morning,
on the princess''s refusing to speak, the Sultan threatened to cut off
her head.  She then confessed all, bidding him ask the vizir''s son if
it were not so.  The Sultan told the vizir to ask his son, who owned
the truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the princess, he had rather
die than go through another such fearful night, and wished to be
separated from her.  His wish was granted, and there was an end of
feasting and rejoicing.

When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the
Sultan of his promise.  She stood in the same place as before, and the
Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for
her.  On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to
keep his word, and asked the vizir''s advice, who counselled him to set
so high a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it.

The Sultan then turned to Aladdin''s mother, saying:  "Good woman, a
Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your
son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried
by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed.
Tell him that I await his answer."  The mother of Aladdin bowed low and
went home, thinking all was lost.

"Not so long, mother, as you think," her son replied "I would do a
great deal more than that for the princess."

He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived,
and filled up the small house and garden.

Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his
mother.  They were so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in
their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold
they carried on their heads.

They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the Sultan, stood
in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed, while
Aladdin''s mother presented them to the Sultan.

He hesitated no longer, but said:  "Good woman, return and tell your
son that I wait for him with open arms."

"I want a scented bath," he said, "a richly embroidered habit, a horse
surpassing the Sultan''s, and twenty slaves to attend me.  Besides this,
six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten
thousand pieces of gold in ten purses."

No sooner said than done.  Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through
the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went.  Those who had
played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so handsome.

When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced him, and
led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to marry him to
the princess that very day.

Once home he said to the genie:  "Build me a palace of the finest
marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones.  In the
middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four walls of
massy gold and silver, each side having six windows, whose lattices,
all except one, which is to be left unfinished, must be set with
diamonds and rubies.  There must be stables and horses and grooms and
slaves; go and see about it!"

The palace was finished by next day, and the genie carried him there
and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out, even to the
laying of a velvet carpet from Aladdin''s palace to the Sultan''s.
Aladdin''s mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked to the
palace with her slaves, while he followed her on horseback.  The Sultan
sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air
resounded with music and cheers.  She was taken to the princess, who
saluted her and treated her with great honour.  At night the princess
said good-bye to her father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin''s
palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the hundred
slaves.  She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive
her.

She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in
this matter.  After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into
the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped with him, after
which they danced till midnight.

Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace.  On entering the
hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies, diamonds, and
emeralds, he cried:

"It is a world''s wonder!  There is only one thing that surprises me.
Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?"

"No, sir, by design," returned Aladdin.  "I wished your Majesty to have
the glory of finishing this palace."

The Sultan was pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city.  He
showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the
others.

The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no
purpose, for in a month''s time the work was not half done.  Aladdin,
knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry
the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his command.  The
Sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited Aladdin,
who showed him the window finished.  The Sultan embraced him, the
envious vizir meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment.

Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing.  He was
made captain of the Sultan''s armies, and won several battles for him,
but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in peace
and content for several years.

But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his
magic arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing miserably in
the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he was
living in great honour and wealth.  He knew that the poor tailor''s son
could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and travelled
night and day till he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin''s
ruin.  As he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere
about a marvellous palace.

"Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin''s palace," was the reply, "the
greatest wonder of the world?  I will direct you if you have a mind to
see it."

The magician thanked him who spoke, and having seen the palace knew
that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp, and became half mad
with rage.  He determined to get hold of the lamp, and again plunge
Aladdin into the deepest poverty.

Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave the
magician plenty of time.  He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them into
a basket, and went to the palace, crying:  "New lamps for old!"
followed by a jeering crowd.

The princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, sent a
slave to find out what the noise was about, who came back laughing, so
that the princess scolded her.

"Madam," replied the slave, "who can help laughing to see an old fool
offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones?"

Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could
not take it out hunting with him.  The princess, not knowing its value,
laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange.

He snatched it and bade the slave take her choice, amid the jeers of
the crowd.  Little he cared, but left off crying his lamps, and went
out of the city gates to a lonely place, where he remained till
nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it.  The genie
appeared, and at the magician''s command carried him, together with the
palace and the princess in it, to a lonely place in Africa.

Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window towards Aladdin''s
palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone.  He sent for the vizir,
and asked what had become of the palace.  The vizir looked out too, and
was lost in astonishment.  He again put it down to enchantment, and
this time the Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to
fetch Aladdin in chains.  They met him riding home, bound him, and
forced him to go with them on foot.  The people, however, who loved
him, followed, armed, to see that he came to no harm.  He was carried
before the Sultan, who ordered the executioner to cut off his head.
The executioner made Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised
his scimitar to strike.

At that instant the vizir, who saw that the crowd had forced their way
into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue Aladdin, called
to the executioner to stay his hand.  The people, indeed, looked so
threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be unbound,
and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd.

"False wretch!" said the Sultan, "come hither," and showed him from the
window the place where his palace had stood.

"Where is my palace and my daughter?" demanded the Sultan.  "For the
first I am not so deeply concerned, but my daughter I must have, and
you must find her or lose your head."

Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her, promising if he
failed to return and suffer death at the Sultan''s pleasure.  His prayer
was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan''s presence.  For
three days he wandered about like a madman, asking everyone what had
become of his palace, but they only laughed and pitied him.  He came to
the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing
himself in.  In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore.

"That is not in my power," said the genie; "I am only the slave of the
ring; you must ask the slave of the lamp."

"Even so," said Aladdin "but thou canst take me to the palace, and set
me down under my dear wife''s window."  He at once found himself in
Africa, under the window of the princess, and fell asleep out of sheer
weariness.

He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter.
He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the
lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.

That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she had
been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced
to endure once a day.  She, however, treated him so harshly that he
dared not live there altogether.  As she was dressing, one of her women
looked out and saw Aladdin.  The princess ran and opened the window,
and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up.  She called to him to come
to her, and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other
again.

After he had kissed her Aladdin said:  "I beg of you, Princess, in
God''s name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sake and
mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in
the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting."

"Alas!" she said "I am the innocent cause of our sorrows," and told him
of the exchange of the lamp.

"Now I know," cried Aladdin, "that we have to thank the African
magician for this!  Where is the lamp?"

"He carries it about with him," said the princess, "I know, for he
pulled it out of his breast to show me.  He wishes me to break my faith
with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded by my father''s
command.  He is forever speaking ill of you, but I only reply by my
tears.  If I persist, I doubt not that he will use violence."

Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while.  He changed clothes
with the first person he met in the town, and having bought a certain
powder returned to the princess, who let him in by a little side door.

"Put on your most beautiful dress," he said to her, "and receive the
magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have forgotten
me.  Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste the wine of
his country.  He will go for some, and while he is gone I will tell you
what to do."

She listened carefully to Aladdin, and when he left her arrayed herself
gaily for the first time since she left China.  She put on a girdle and
head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in a glass that she looked more
beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying to his great
amazement:  "I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that all
my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no
more, and have therefore invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of
the wines of China, and would fain taste those of Africa."

The magician flew to his cellar, and the princess put the powder
Aladdin had given her in her cup.  When he returned she asked him to
drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in exchange
for his as a sign she was reconciled to him.

Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty,
but the princess cut him short saying:

"Let me drink first, and you shall say what you will afterwards." She
set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained
his to the dregs and fell back lifeless.

The princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her arms round
his neck, but Aladdin put her away, bidding her to leave him, as he had
more to do.  He then went to the dead magician, took the lamp out of
his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to
China.  This was done, and the princess in her chamber only felt two
little shocks, and little thought she was at home again.

The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for his lost
daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for there stood the
palace as before!  He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him in the
hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the princess at his side.
Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the
magician, that he might believe.  A ten days'' feast was proclaimed, and
it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace;
but it was not to be.

The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more
wicked and more cunning than himself.  He travelled to China to avenge
his brother''s death, and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima,
thinking she might be of use to him.  He entered her cell and clapped a
dagger to her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of
death.  He changed clothes with her, coloured his face like hers, put
on her veil and murdered her, that she might tell no tales.  Then he
went towards the palace of Aladdin, and all the people thinking he was
the holy woman, gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his
blessing.  When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on
round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and
ask what was the matter.  The slave said it was the holy woman, curing
people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the princess, who had
long desired to see Fatima, sent for her.  On coming to the princess
the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity.  When
he had done the princess made him sit by her, and begged him to stay
with her always.  The false Fatima, who wished for nothing better,
consented, but kept his veil down for fear of discovery.  The princess
showed him the hall, and asked him what he thought of it.

"If only a roc''s egg," replied he, "were hung up from the middle of
this dome, it would be the wonder of the world."

After this the princess could think of nothing but a roc''s egg, and
when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humour.
He begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her
pleasure in the hall was spoilt for the want of a roc''s egg hanging
from the dome.

He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded
him to bring a roc''s egg.  The genie gave such a loud and terrible
shriek that the hall shook.

"Wretch!" he cried, "is it not enough that I have done everything for
you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the
midst of this dome?  You and your wife and your palace deserve to be
burnt to ashes; but this request does not come from you, but from the
brother of the African magician whom you destroyed.  He is now in your
palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered.  He it was who
put that wish into your wife''s head.  Take care of yourself, for he
means to kill you."  So saying the genie disappeared.

Aladdin went back to the princess, saying his head ached, and
requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on
it.  But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger,
pierced him to the heart.

After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace.  He succeeded the
Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind him a
long line of kings.

The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace, wondering if there was
anything left in the world that could possibly give him a few hours''
amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and tried friend,
suddenly appeared before him.  Bowing low, he waited, as was his duty,
till his master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid merely turned his head and
looked at him, and sank back into his former weary posture.

Now Giafar had something of importance to say to the Caliph, and had no
intention of being put off by mere silence, so with another low bow in
front of the throne, he began to speak.

"Commander of the Faithful," said he, "I have taken on myself to remind
your Highness that you have undertaken secretly to observe for yourself
the manner in which justice is done and order is kept throughout the
city.  This is the day you have set apart to devote to this object, and
perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find some distraction from the
melancholy to which, as I see to my sorrow, you are a prey."

"You are right," returned the Caliph, "I had forgotten all about it.
Go and change your coat, and I will change mine."

A few moments later they both re-entered the hall, disguised as foreign
merchants, and passed through a secret door, out into the open country.
Here they turned towards the Euphrates, and crossing the river in a
small boat, walked through that part of the town which lay along the
further bank, without seeing anything to call for their interference.
Much pleased with the peace and good order of the city, the Caliph and
his vizir made their way to a bridge, which led straight back to the
palace, and had already crossed it, when they were stopped by an old
and blind man, who begged for alms.

The Caliph gave him a piece of money, and was passing on, but the blind
man seized his hand, and held him fast.

"Charitable person," he said, "whoever you may be grant me yet another
prayer.  Strike me, I beg of you, one blow.  I have deserved it richly,
and even a more severe penalty."

The Caliph, much surprised at this request, replied gently: "My good
man, that which you ask is impossible.  Of what use would my alms be if
I treated you so ill?"  And as he spoke he tried to loosen the grasp of
the blind beggar.

"My lord," answered the man, "pardon my boldness and my persistence.
Take back your money, or give me the blow which I crave.  I have sworn
a solemn oath that I will receive nothing without receiving
chastisement, and if you knew all, you would feel that the punishment
is not a tenth part of what I deserve."

Moved by these words, and perhaps still more by the fact that he had
other business to attend to, the Caliph yielded, and struck him lightly
on the shoulder.  Then he continued his road, followed by the blessing
of the blind man.  When they were out of earshot, he said to the vizir,
"There must be something very odd to make that man act so--I should
like to find out what is the reason.  Go back to him; tell him who I
am, and order him to come without fail to the palace to-morrow, after
the hour of evening prayer."

So the grand-vizir went back to the bridge; gave the blind beggar first
a piece of money and then a blow, delivered the Caliph''s message, and
rejoined his master.

They passed on towards the palace, but walking through a square, they
came upon a crowd watching a young and well-dressed man who was urging
a horse at full speed round the open space, using at the same time his
spurs and whip so unmercifully that the animal was all covered with
foam and blood.  The Caliph, astonished at this proceeding, inquired of
a passer-by what it all meant, but no one could tell him anything,
except that every day at the same hour the same thing took place.

Still wondering, he passed on, and for the moment had to content
himself with telling the vizir to command the horseman also to appear
before him at the same time as the blind man.

The next day, after evening prayer, the Caliph entered the hall, and
was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men of whom we have
spoken, and a third, with whom we have nothing to do.  They all bowed
themselves low before the throne and then the Caliph bade them rise,
and ask the blind man his name.

"Baba-Abdalla," returned the Caliph, "your way of asking alms yesterday
seemed to me so strange, that I almost commanded you then and there to
cease from causing such a public scandal.  But I have sent for you to
inquire what was your motive in making such a curious vow.  When I know
the reason I shall be able to judge whether you can be permitted to
continue to practise it, for I cannot help thinking that it sets a very
bad example to others.  Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal
nothing."

These words troubled the heart of Baba-Abdalla, who prostrated himself
at the feet of the Caliph.  Then rising, he answered: "Commander of the
Faithful, I crave your pardon humbly, for my persistence in beseeching
your Highness to do an action which appears on the face of it to be
without any meaning.  No doubt, in the eyes of men, it has none; but I
look on it as a slight expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been
guilty, and if your Highness will deign to listen to my tale, you will
see that no punishment could atone for the crime."

I was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and was left an
orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents died within a
few days of each other.  I had inherited from them a small fortune,
which I worked hard night and day to increase, till at last I found
myself the owner of eighty camels.  These I hired out to travelling
merchants, whom I frequently accompanied on their various journeys, and
always returned with large profits.

One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supply of
goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a lonely place, which
promised rich pasture for my camels.  I was resting in the shade under
a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora, sat down by my
side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what place he was going.
We soon made friends, and after we had asked each other the usual
questions, we produced the food we had with us, and satisfied our
hunger.

While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a spot
only a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hidden a
treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they could
carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if it had never
been touched.

At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and I
flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:  "Good
dervish, I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to
you, therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you?
Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful.  But tell me
where it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give you one
of them as a token of my gratitude."

Certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it was great to
me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over my heart,
and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camels that were left were
nothing in comparison.

The dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind, but he did not
show what he thought of my proposal.

"My brother," he answered quietly, "you know as well as I do, that you
are behaving unjustly.  It was open to me to keep my secret, and to
reserve the treasure for myself.  But the fact that I have told you of
its existence shows that I had confidence in you, and that I hoped to
earn your gratitude for ever, by making your fortune as well as mine.
But before I reveal to you the secret of the treasure, you must swear
that, after we have loaded the camels with as much as they can carry,
you will give half to me, and let us go our own ways.  I think you will
see that this is fair, for if you present me with forty camels, I on my
side will give you the means of buying a thousand more."

I could not of course deny that what the dervish said was perfectly
reasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the dervish would
be as rich as I was unbearable to me.  Still there was no use in
discussing the matter, and I had to accept his conditions or bewail to
the end of my life the loss of immense wealth.  So I collected my
camels and we set out together under the guidance of the dervish.
After walking some time, we reached what looked like a valley, but with
such a narrow entrance that my camels could only pass one by one.  The
little valley, or open space, was shut up by two mountains, whose sides
were formed of straight cliffs, which no human being could climb.

"Make your camels lie down in this open space," he said, "so that we
can easily load them; then we will go to the treasure."

I did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish, whom I found trying to
kindle a fire out of some dry wood.  As soon as it was alight, he threw
on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few words that I did not
understand, and immediately a thick column of smoke rose high into the
air.  He separated the smoke into two columns, and then I saw a rock,
which stood like a pillar between the two mountains, slowly open, and a
splendid palace appear within.

But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold had taken such
possession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examine the
riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach and began
to heap it into a sack that I had brought with me.

The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon noticed that he confined
himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt I should be wise to
follow his example.  At length the camels were loaded with as much as
they could carry, and nothing remained but to seal up the treasure, and
go our ways.

Before, however, this was done, the dervish went up to a great golden
vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden box, which he
hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that it contained a
special kind of ointment.  Then he once more kindled the fire, threw on
the perfume, and murmured the unknown spell, and the rock closed, and
stood whole as before.

The next thing was to divide the camels, and to charge them with the
treasure, after which we each took command of our own and marched out
of the valley, till we reached the place in the high road where the
routes diverge, and then we parted, the dervish going towards Balsora,
and I to Bagdad.  We embraced each other tenderly, and I poured out my
gratitude for the honour he had done me, in singling me out for this
great wealth, and having said a hearty farewell we turned our backs,
and hastened after our camels.

I had hardly come up with mine when the demon of envy filled my soul.
"What does a dervish want with riches like that?"  I said to myself.
"He alone has the secret of the treasure, and can always get as much as
he wants," and I halted my camels by the roadside, and ran back after
him.

I was a quick runner, and it did not take me very long to come up with
him.  "My brother," I exclaimed, as soon as I could speak, "almost at
the moment of our leave-taking, a reflection occurred to me, which is
perhaps new to you.  You are a dervish by profession, and live a very
quiet life, only caring to do good, and careless of the things of this
world.  You do not realise the burden that you lay upon yourself, when
you gather into your hands such great wealth, besides the fact that no
one, who is not accustomed to camels from his birth, can ever manage
the stubborn beasts.  If you are wise, you will not encumber yourself
with more than thirty, and you will find those trouble enough."

"You are right," replied the dervish, who understood me quite well, but
did not wish to fight the matter.  "I confess I had not thought about
it.  Choose any ten you like, and drive them before you."

I selected ten of the best camels, and we proceeded along the road, to
rejoin those I had left behind.  I had got what I wanted, but I had
found the dervish so easy to deal with, that I rather regretted I had
not asked for ten more.  I looked back.  He had only gone a few paces,
and I called after him.

"My brother," I said, "I am unwilling to part from you without pointing
out what I think you scarcely grasp, that large experience of
camel-driving is necessary to anybody who intends to keep together a
troop of thirty.  In your own interest, I feel sure you would be much
happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me, for with my practice
it is all one to me if I take two or a hundred."

As before, the dervish made no difficulties, and I drove off my ten
camels in triumph, only leaving him with twenty for his share.  I had
now sixty, and anyone might have imagined that I should be content.

But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a proverb that says, "the more
one has, the more one wants."  So it was with me.  I could not rest as
long as one solitary camel remained to the dervish; and returning to
him I redoubled my prayers and embraces, and promises of eternal
gratitude, till the last twenty were in my hands.

"Make a good use of them, my brother," said the holy man.  "Remember
riches sometimes have wings if we keep them for ourselves, and the poor
are at our gates expressly that we may help them."

My eyes were so blinded by gold, that I paid no heed to his wise
counsel, and only looked about for something else to grasp.  Suddenly I
remembered the little box of ointment that the dervish had hidden, and
which most likely contained a treasure more precious than all the rest.
Giving him one last embrace, I observed accidentally, "What are you
going to do with that little box of ointment?  It seems hardly worth
taking with you; you might as well let me have it.  And really, a
dervish who has given up the world has no need of ointment!"

Oh, if he had only refused my request!  But then, supposing he had, I
should have got possession of it by force, so great was the madness
that had laid hold upon me.  However, far from refusing it, the dervish
at once held it out, saying gracefully, "Take it, my friend, and if
there is anything else I can do to make you happy you must let me know."

Directly the box was in my hands I wrenched off the cover.  "As you are
so kind," I said, "tell me, I pray you, what are the virtues of this
ointment?"

"They are most curious and interesting," replied the dervish.  "If you
apply a little of it to your left eye you will behold in an instant all
the treasures hidden in the bowels of the earth.  But beware lest you
touch your right eye with it, or your sight will be destroyed for ever."

His words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch.  "Make trial on
me, I implore you," I cried, holding out the box to the dervish.  "You
will know how to do it better than I!  I am burning with impatience to
test its charms."

The dervish took the box I had extended to him, and, bidding me shut my
left eye, touched it gently with the ointment.  When I opened it again
I saw spread out, as it were before me, treasures of every kind and
without number.  But as all this time I had been obliged to keep my
right eye closed, which was very fatiguing, I begged the dervish to
apply the ointment to that eye also.

"If you insist upon it I will do it," answered the dervish, "but you
must remember what I told you just now--that if it touches your right
eye you will become blind on the spot."

Unluckily, in spite of my having proved the truth of the dervish''s
words in so many instances, I was firmly convinced that he was now
keeping concealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the
ointment.  So I turned a deaf ear to all he said.

"My brother," I replied smiling, "I see you are joking.  It is not
natural that the same ointment should have two such exactly opposite
effects."

"It is true all the same," answered the dervish, "and it would be well
for you if you believed my word."

But I would not believe, and, dazzled by the greed of avarice, I
thought that if one eye could show me riches, the other might teach me
how to get possession of them.  And I continued to press the dervish to
anoint my right eye, but this he resolutely declined to do.

"After having conferred such benefits on you," said he, "I am loth
indeed to work you such evil.  Think what it is to be blind, and do not
force me to do what you will repent as long as you live."

It was of no use.  "My brother," I said firmly, "pray say no more, but
do what I ask.  You have most generously responded to my wishes up to
this time, do not spoil my recollection of you for a thing of such
little consequence.  Let what will happen I take it on my own head, and
will never reproach you."

"Since you are determined upon it," he answered with a sigh, "there is
no use talking," and taking the ointment he laid some on my right eye,
which was tight shut.  When I tried to open it heavy clouds of darkness
floated before me.  I was as blind as you see me now!

"Miserable dervish!"  I shrieked, "so it is true after all!  Into what
a bottomless pit has my lust after gold plunged me.  Ah, now that my
eyes are closed they are really opened.  I know that all my sufferings
are caused by myself alone!  But, good brother, you, who are so kind
and charitable, and know the secrets of such vast learning, have you
nothing that will give me back my sight?"

"Unhappy man," replied the dervish, "it is not my fault that this has
befallen you, but it is a just chastisement.  The blindness of your
heart has wrought the blindness of your body.  Yes, I have secrets;
that you have seen in the short time that we have known each other.
But I have none that will give you back your sight.  You have proved
yourself unworthy of the riches that were given you.  Now they have
passed into my hands, whence they will flow into the hands of others
less greedy and ungrateful than you."

The dervish said no more and left me, speechless with shame and
confusion, and so wretched that I stood rooted to the spot, while he
collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his way to Balsora.  It
was in vain that I entreated him not to leave me, but at least to take
me within reach of the first passing caravan.  He was deaf to my
prayers and cries, and I should soon have been dead of hunger and
misery if some merchants had not come along the track the following day
and kindly brought me back to Bagdad.

From a rich man I had in one moment become a beggar; and up to this
time I have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed on me.
But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my undoing, I
oblige each passer-by to give me a blow.

When the blind man had ended the Caliph addressed him: "Baba-Abdalla,
truly your sin is great, but you have suffered enough.  Henceforth
repent in private, for I will see that enough money is given you day by
day for all your wants."

At these words Baba-Abdalla flung himself at the Caliph''s feet, and
prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for ever.

The Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased with the tale of the
blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he turned to the
young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquired his name also.
The young man replied that he was called Sidi-Nouman.

"Sidi-Nouman," observed the Caliph, "I have seen horses broken all my
life long, and have even broken them myself, but I have never seen any
horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you yesterday.  Every one
who looked on was indignant, and blamed you loudly.  As for myself, I
was so angry that I was very nearly disclosing who I was, and putting a
stop to it at once.  Still, you have not the air of a cruel man, and I
would gladly believe that you did not act in this way without some
reason.  As I am told that it was not the first time, and indeed that
every day you are to be seen flogging and spurring your horse, I wish
to come to the bottom of the matter.  But tell me the whole truth, and
conceal nothing."

Sidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these words, and his manner grew
confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help for it.  So he
prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and tried to obey,
but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained silent.

The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant obedience, guessed
something of what was passing in the young man''s mind, and sought to
put him at his ease.  "Sidi-Nouman," he said, "do not think of me as
the Caliph, but merely as a friend who would like to hear your story.
If there is anything in it that you are afraid may offend me, take
courage, for I pardon you beforehand.  Speak then openly and without
fear, as to one who knows and loves you."

"Commander of the Faithful," said he, "dazzled though I am by the
lustre of your Highness'' presence, I will do my best to satisfy your
wishes.  I am by no means perfect, but I am not naturally cruel,
neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law.  I admit that the
treatment of my horse is calculated to give your Highness a bad opinion
of me, and to set an evil example to others; yet I have not chastised
it without reason, and I have hopes that I shall be judged more worthy
of pity than punishment."

Commander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to describe my birth; it
is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your Highness'' attention.
My ancestors were careful people, and I inherited enough money to
enable me to live comfortably, though without show.

Having therefore a modest fortune, the only thing wanting to my
happiness was a wife who could return my affection, but this blessing I
was not destined to get; for on the very day after my marriage, my
bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hard to bear.

Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry without
ever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our lives, a man has
of course no right to complain as long as his wife is not absolutely
repulsive, or is not positively deformed.  And whatever defects her
body may have, pleasant ways and good behaviour will go far to remedy
them.

The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been brought to my
house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find that I had not
been deceived in regard to the account that had been given me of her
beauty.  I began my married life in high spirits, and the best hopes of
happiness.

The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did
not appear, I ordered a servant to call her.  Still she did not come,
and I waited impatiently for some time.  At last she entered the room,
and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were set
before us.

I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my surprise to
notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from her pocket a
little case, from which she selected a long pin, and by the help of
this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth.

"Amina," I exclaimed in astonishment, "is that the way you eat rice at
home?  And did you do it because your appetite was so small, or did you
wish to count the grains so that you might never eat more than a
certain number?  If it was from economy, and you are anxious to teach
me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm.  We shall never
ruin ourselves in that way!  Our fortune is large enough for all our
needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek to check yourself, but eat as
much as you desire, as I do!"

In reply to my affectionate words, I expected a cheerful answer; yet
Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her rice as before,
only at longer and longer intervals.  And, instead of trying the other
dishes, all she did was to put every now and then a crumb, of bread
into her mouth, that would not have made a meal for a sparrow.

I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse her to myself as far as
I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never been used to eat in the
company of men, and that her family might have taught her that she
ought to behave prudently and discreetly in the presence of her
husband.  Likewise that she might either have dined already or intend
to do so in her own apartments.  So I took no further notice, and when
I had finished left the room, secretly much vexed at her strange
conduct.

The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day,
whenever we ate together.  It was quite clear that no woman could live
upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains of rice, and I
determined to find out how and when she got food.  I pretended not to
pay attention to anything she did, in the hope that little by little
she would get accustomed to me, and become more friendly; but I soon
saw that my expectations were quite vain.

One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and to, all appearance sound
asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself without making the
slightest sound.  I could not imagine what she was going to do, and as
my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her.  When she was
fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room.

The instant she had let the curtain fall behind her, I flung a garment
on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet.  Looking from a
lattice which opened into the court, I saw her in the act of passing
through the street door, which she carefully left open.

It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to keep her in sight, till
she entered a cemetery not far from the house.  There I hid myself
under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down cautiously; and hardly
was I concealed, when I saw my wife approaching in company with a
ghoul--one of those demons which, as your Highness is aware, wander
about the country making their lairs in deserted buildings and
springing out upon unwary travellers whose flesh they eat.  If no live
being goes their way, they then betake themselves to the cemeteries,
and feed upon the dead bodies.

I was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with this
hideous female ghoul.  They passed by me without noticing me, began to
dig up a corpse which had been buried that day, and then sat down on
the edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast, talking quietly
and cheerfully all the while, though I was too far off to hear what
they said.  When they had finished, they threw back the body into the
grave, and heaped back the earth upon it.  I made no effort to disturb
them, and returned quickly to the house, when I took care to leave the
door open, as I had previously found it.  Then I got back into bed, and
pretended to sleep soundly.

A short time after Amina entered as quietly as she had gone out.  She
undressed and stole into bed, congratulating herself apparently on the
cleverness with which she had managed her expedition.

As may be guessed, after such a scene it was long before I could close
my eyes, and at the first sound which called the faithful to prayer, I
put on my clothes and went to the mosque.  But even prayer did not
restore peace to my troubled spirit, and I could not face my wife until
I had made up my mind what future course I should pursue in regard to
her.  I therefore spent the morning roaming about from one garden to
another, turning over various plans for compelling my wife to give up
her horrible ways; I thought of using violence to make her submit, but
felt reluctant to be unkind to her.  Besides, I had an instinct that
gentle means had the best chance of success; so, a little soothed, I
turned towards home, which I reached about the hour of dinner.

As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered dinner to be served, and we sat
down together.  As usual, she persisted in only picking a few grains of
rice, and I resolved to speak to her at once of what lay so heavily on
my heart.

"Amina," I said, as quietly as possible, "you must have guessed the
surprise I felt, when the day after our marriage you declined to eat
anything but a few morsels of rice, and altogether behaved in such a
manner that most husbands would have been deeply wounded.  However I
had patience with you, and only tried to tempt your appetite by the
choicest dishes I could invent, but all to no purpose.  Still, Amina,
it seems to me that there be some among them as sweet to the taste as
the flesh of a corpse?"

I had no sooner uttered these words than Amina, who instantly
understood that I had followed her to the grave-yard, was seized with a
passion beyond any that I have ever witnessed.  Her face became purple,
her eyes looked as if they would start from her head, and she
positively foamed with rage.

I watched her with terror, wondering what would happen next, but little
thinking what would be the end of her fury.  She seized a vessel of
water that stood at hand, and plunging her hand in it, murmured some
words I failed to catch.  Then, sprinkling it on my face, she cried
madly:

The words were not out of her mouth when, without feeling conscious
that any change was passing over me, I suddenly knew that I had ceased
to be a man.  In the greatness of the shock and surprise--for I had no
idea that Amina was a magician--I never dreamed of running away, and
stood rooted to the spot, while Amina grasped a stick and began to beat
me.  Indeed her blows were so heavy, that I only wonder they did not
kill me at once.  However they succeeded in rousing me from my stupor,
and I dashed into the court-yard, followed closely by Amina, who made
frantic dives at me, which I was not quick enough to dodge.  At last
she got tired of pursuing me, or else a new trick entered into her
head, which would give me speedy and painful death; she opened the gate
leading into the street, intending to crush me as I passed through.
Dog though I was, I saw through her design, and stung into presence of
mind by the greatness of the danger, I timed my movements so well that
I contrived to rush through, and only the tip of my tail received a
squeeze as she banged the gate.

I was safe, but my tail hurt me horribly, and I yelped and howled so
loud all along the streets, that the other dogs came and attacked me,
which made matters no better.  In order to avoid them, I took refuge in
a cookshop, where tongues and sheep''s heads were sold.

At first the owner showed me great kindness, and drove away the other
dogs that were still at my heels, while I crept into the darkest
corner.  But though I was safe for the moment, I was not destined to
remain long under his protection, for he was one of those who hold all
dogs to be unclean, and that all the washing in the world will hardly
purify you from their contact.  So after my enemies had gone to seek
other prey, he tried to lure me from my corner in order to force me
into the street.  But I refused to come out of my hole, and spent the
night in sleep, which I sorely needed, after the pain inflicted on me
by Amina.

I have no wish to weary your Highness by dwelling on the sad thoughts
which accompanied my change of shape, but it may interest you to hear
that the next morning my host went out early to do his marketing, and
returned laden with the sheep''s heads, and tongues and trotters that
formed his stock in trade for the day.  The smell of meat attracted
various hungry dogs in the neighbourhood, and they gathered round the
door begging for some bits.  I stole out of my corner, and stood with
them.

In spite of his objection to dogs, as unclean animals, my protector was
a kind-hearted man, and knowing I had eaten nothing since yesterday, he
threw me bigger and better bits than those which fell to the share of
the other dogs.  When I had finished, I tried to go back into the shop,
but this he would not allow, and stood so firmly at the entrance with a
stout stick, that I was forced to give it up, and seek some other home.

A few paces further on was a baker''s shop, which seemed to have a gay
and merry man for a master.  At that moment he was having his
breakfast, and though I gave no signs of hunger, he at once threw me a
piece of bread.  Before gobbling it up, as most dogs are in the habit
of doing, I bowed my head and wagged my tail, in token of thanks, and
he understood, and smiled pleasantly.  I really did not want the bread
at all, but felt it would be ungracious to refuse, so I ate it slowly,
in order that he might see that I only did it out of politeness.  He
understood this also, and seemed quite willing to let me stay in his
shop, so I sat down, with my face to the door, to show that I only
asked his protection.  This he gave me, and indeed encouraged me to
come into the house itself, giving me a corner where I might sleep,
without being in anybody''s way.

The kindness heaped on me by this excellent man was far greater than I
could ever have expected.  He was always affectionate in his manner of
treating me, and I shared his breakfast, dinner and supper, while, on
my side, I gave him all the gratitude and attachment to which he had a
right.

I sat with my eyes fixed on him, and he never left the house without
having me at his heels; and if it ever happened that when he was
preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice, he would call
"Rufus, Rufus," for that was the name he gave me.

Some weeks passed in this way, when one day a woman came in to buy
bread.  In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of money, one of
which was bad.  The baker perceived this, and declined to take it,
demanding another in its place.  The woman, for her part, refused to
take it back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the baker would have
nothing to do with it.  "It is really such a bad imitation," he
exclaimed at last, "that even my dog would not be taken in.  Here
Rufus!  Rufus!" and hearing his voice, I jumped on to the counter.  The
baker threw down the money before me, and said, "Find out if there is a
bad coin."  I looked at each in turn, and then laid my paw on the false
one, glancing at the same time at my master, so as to point it out.

The baker, who had of course been only in joke, was exceedingly
surprised at my cleverness, and the woman, who was at last convinced
that the man spoke the truth, produced another piece of money in its
place.  When she had gone, my master was so pleased that he told all
the neighbours what I had done, and made a great deal more of it than
there really was.

The neighbours, very naturally, declined to believe his story, and
tried me several times with all the bad money they could collect
together, but I never failed to stand the test triumphantly.

Soon, the shop was filled from morning till night, with people who on
the pretence of buying bread came to see if I was as clever as I was
reported to be.  The baker drove a roaring trade, and admitted that I
was worth my weight in gold to him.

Of course there were plenty who envied him his large custom, and many
was the pitfall set for me, so that he never dared to let me out of his
sight.  One day a woman, who had not been in the shop before, came to
ask for bread, like the rest.  As usual, I was lying on the counter,
and she threw down six coins before me, one of which was false.  I
detected it at once, and put my paw on it, looking as I did so at the
woman.  "Yes," she said, nodding her head.  "You are quite right, that
is the one."  She stood gazing at me attentively for some time, then
paid for the bread, and left the shop, making a sign for me to follow
her secretly.

Now my thoughts were always running on some means of shaking off the
spell laid on me, and noticing the way in which this woman had looked
at me, the idea entered my head that perhaps she might have guessed
what had happened, and in this I was not deceived.  However I let her
go on a little way, and merely stood at the door watching her.  She
turned, and seeing that I was quite still, she again beckoned to me.

The baker all this while was busy with his oven, and had forgotten all
about me, so I stole out softly, and ran after the woman.

When we came to her house, which was some distance off, she opened the
door and then said to me, "Come in, come in; you will never be sorry
that you followed me."  When I had entered she fastened the door, and
took me into a large room, where a beautiful girl was working at a
piece of embroidery.  "My daughter," exclaimed my guide, "I have
brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker which can tell good
money from bad.  You know that when I first heard of him, I told you I
was sure he must be really a man, changed into a dog by magic.  To-day
I went to the baker''s, to prove for myself the truth of the story, and
persuaded the dog to follow me here.  Now what do you say?"

"You are right, mother," replied the girl, and rising she dipped her
hand into a vessel of water.  Then sprinkling it over me she said, "If
you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born man, by virtue of
this water resume your proper form."  In one moment the spell was
broken.  The dog''s shape vanished as if it had never been, and it was a
man who stood before her.

Overcome with gratitude at my deliverance, I flung myself at her feet,
and kissed the hem of her garment.  "How can I thank you for your
goodness towards a stranger, and for what you have done?  Henceforth I
am your slave.  Deal with me as you will!"

Then, in order to explain how I came to be changed into a dog, I told
her my whole story, and finished with rendering the mother the thanks
due to her for the happiness she had brought me.

"Sidi-Nouman," returned the daughter, "say no more about the obligation
you are under to us.  The knowledge that we have been of service to you
is ample payment.  Let us speak of Amina, your wife, with whom I was
acquainted before her marriage.  I was aware that she was a magician,
and she knew too that I had studied the same art, under the same
mistress.  We met often going to the same baths, but we did not like
each other, and never sought to become friends.  As to what concerns
you, it is not enough to have broken your spell, she must be punished
for her wickedness.  Remain for a moment with my mother, I beg," she
added hastily, "I will return shortly."

Left alone with the mother, I again expressed the gratitude I felt, to
her as well as to her daughter.

"My daughter," she answered, "is, as you see, as accomplished a
magician as Amina herself, but you would be astonished at the amount of
good she does by her knowledge.  That is why I have never interfered,
otherwise I should have put a stop to it long ago."  As she spoke, her
daughter entered with a small bottle in her hand.

"Sidi-Nouman," she said, "the books I have just consulted tell me that
Amina is not home at present, but she should return at any moment.  I
have likewise found out by their means, that she pretends before the
servants great uneasiness as to your absence.  She has circulated a
story that, while at dinner with her, you remembered some important
business that had to be done at once, and left the house without
shutting the door.  By this means a dog had strayed in, which she was
forced to get rid of by a stick.  Go home then without delay, and await
Amina''s return in your room.  When she comes in, go down to meet her,
and in her surprise, she will try to run away.  Then have this bottle
ready, and dash the water it contains over her, saying boldly, "Receive
the reward of your crimes." That is all I have to tell you."

Everything happened exactly as the young magician had foretold.  I had
not been in my house many minutes before Amina returned, and as she
approached I stepped in front of her, with the water in my hand.  She
gave one loud cry, and turned to the door, but she was too late.  I had
already dashed the water in her face and spoken the magic words.  Amina
disappeared, and in her place stood the horse you saw me beating
yesterday.

This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story, and may I venture to hope
that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct, your Highness will
not think this wicked woman too harshly treated?

"Sidi-Nouman," replied the Caliph, "your story is indeed a strange one,
and there is no excuse to be offered for your wife.  But, without
condemning your treatment of her, I wish you to reflect how much she
must suffer from being changed into an animal, and I hope you will let
that punishment be enough.  I do not order you to insist upon the young
magician finding the means to restore your wife to her human shape,
because I know that when once women such as she begin to work evil they
never leave off, and I should only bring down on your head a vengeance
far worse than the one you have undergone already."

In the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad a merchant
named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child, contented himself
with the modest profits produced by his trade.  He had spent some years
quite happily in the house his father had left him, when three nights
running he dreamed that an old man had appeared to him, and reproached
him for having neglected the duty of a good Mussulman, in delaying so
long his pilgrimage to Mecca.

Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he was unwilling to give
up his shop, and lose all his customers.  He had shut his eyes for some
time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage, and tried to atone
to his conscience by an extra number of good works, but the dream
seemed to him a direct warning, and he resolved to put the journey off
no longer.

The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares he had
in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he might trade
with on the road.  The shop itself he sold also, and easily found a
tenant for his private house.  The only matter he could not settle
satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand pieces of gold which
he wished to leave behind him.

After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one.
He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom of it, filled
up the rest with olives.  After corking the vase tightly down, he
carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself, and said to
him:

"My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a caravan
in a few days for Mecca.  I have come to ask whether you would do me
the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come back?"

The merchant replied readily, "Look, this is the key of my shop: take
it, and put the vase wherever you like.  I promise that you shall find
it in the same place on your return."

A few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel that he had laden with
merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time at Mecca.
Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque, and after all his
religious duties were performed, he set out his goods to the best
advantage, hoping to gain some customers among the passers-by.

Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when they had
turned it over, one said to the other:

"If this man was wise he would take these things to Cairo, where he
would get a much better price than he is likely to do here."

Ali Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in following the advice.
He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad, joined a
caravan that was going to Cairo.  The results of the journey gladdened
his heart.  He sold off everything almost directly, and bought a stock
of Egyptian curiosities, which he intended selling at Damascus; but as
the caravan with which he would have to travel would not be starting
for another six weeks, he took advantage of the delay to visit the
Pyramids, and some of the cities along the banks of the Nile.

Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated the worthy Ali, that he
could hardly tear himself away, but at length he remembered that he had
a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo, and after he had
crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of the Tigris.

But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with some
Persian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them to their
native land, and even as far as India, and so it came to pass that
seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad, and during all
that time the friend with whom he had left the vase of olives had never
once thought of him or of it.  In fact, it was only a month before Ali
Cogia''s actual return that the affair came into his head at all, owing
to his wife''s remarking one day, that it was a long time since she had
eaten any olives, and would like some.

"That reminds me," said the husband, "that before Ali Cogia went to
Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of olives in my care.  But really
by this time he must be dead, and there is no reason we should not eat
the olives if we like.  Give me a light, and I will fetch them and see
how they taste."

"My husband," answered the wife, "beware, I pray, of your doing
anything so base!  Supposing seven years have passed without news of
Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and may come back any day.
How shameful it would be to have to confess that you had betrayed your
trust and broken the seal of the vase!  Pay no attention to my idle
words, I really have no desire for olives now.  And probably after all
this while they are no longer good.  I have a presentiment that Ali
Cogia will return, and what will he think of you?  Give it up, I
entreat."

The merchant, however, refused to listen to her advice, sensible though
it was.  He took a light and a dish and went into his shop.

"If you will be so obstinate," said his wife, "I cannot help it; but do
not blame me if it turns out ill."

When the merchant opened the vase he found the topmost olives were
rotten, and in order to see if the under ones were in better condition
he shook some out into the dish.  As they fell out a few of the gold
pieces fell out too.

The sight of the money roused all the merchant''s greed.  He looked into
the vase, and saw that all the bottom was filled with gold.  He then
replaced the olives and returned to his wife.

"My wife," he said, as he entered the room, "you were quite right; the
olives are rotten, and I have recorked the vase so well that Ali Cogia
will never know it has been touched."

"You would have done better to believe me," replied the wife.  "I trust
that no harm will come of it."

These words made no more impression on the merchant than the others had
done; and he spent the whole night in wondering how he could manage to
keep the gold if Ali Cogia should come back and claim his vase.  Very
early next morning he went out and bought fresh new olives; he then
threw away the old ones, took out the gold and hid it, and filled up
the vase with the olives he had bought.  This done he recorked the vase
and put it in the same place where it had been left by Ali Cogia.

A month later Ali Cogia re-entered Bagdad, and as his house was still
let he went to an inn; and the following day set out to see his friend
the merchant, who received him with open arms and many expressions of
surprise.  After a few moments given to inquiries Ali Cogia begged the
merchant to hand him over the vase that he had taken care of for so
long.

"Oh certainly," said he, "I am only glad I could be of use to you in
the matter.  Here is the key of my shop; you will find the vase in the
place where you put it."

Ali Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn, where
he opened it.  He thrust down his hand but could feel no money, but
still was persuaded it must be there.  So he got some plates and
vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives.  To no
purpose.  The gold was not there.  The poor man was dumb with horror,
then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, "Can my old friend really
have committed such a crime?"

In great haste he went back to the house of the merchant.  "My friend,"
he cried, "you will be astonished to see me again, but I can find
nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I placed in the
bottom under the olives.  Perhaps you may have taken a loan of them for
your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome.  I will
only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the money at your
leisure."

The merchant, who had expected something of the sort, had his reply all
ready.  "Ali Cogia," he said, "when you brought me the vase of olives
did I ever touch it?"

"I gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you liked,
and did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in the same state?
If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still.  I know nothing
about that; you only told me there were olives.  You can believe me or
not, but I have not laid a finger on the vase."

Ali Cogia still tried every means to persuade the merchant to admit the
truth.  "I love peace," he said, "and shall deeply regret having to
resort to harsh measures.  Once more, think of your reputation.  I
shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the aid of the law."

"Ali Cogia," answered the merchant, "you allow that it was a vase of
olives you placed in my charge.  You fetched it and removed it
yourself, and now you tell me it contained a thousand pieces of gold,
and that I must restore them to you!  Did you ever say anything about
them before?  Why, I did not even know that the vase had olives in it!
You never showed them to me.  I wonder you have not demanded pearls or
diamonds.  Retire, I pray you, lest a crowd should gather in front of
my shop."

By this time not only the casual passers-by, but also the neighbouring
merchants, were standing round, listening to the dispute, and trying
every now and then to smooth matters between them.  But at the
merchant''s last words Ali Cogia resolved to lay the cause of the
quarrel before them, and told them the whole story.  They heard him to
the end, and inquired of the merchant what he had to say.

The accused man admitted that he had kept Ali Cogia''s vase in his shop;
but he denied having touched it, and swore that as to what it contained
he only knew what Ali Cogia had told him, and called them all to
witness the insult that had been put upon him.

"You have brought it on yourself," said Ali Cogia, taking him by the
arm, "and as you appeal to the law, the law you shall have!  Let us see
if you will dare to repeat your story before the Cadi."

Now as a good Mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse this
choice of a judge, so he accepted the test, and said to Ali Cogia,
"Very well; I should like nothing better.  We shall soon see which of
us is in the right."

So the two men presented themselves before the Cadi, and Ali Cogia
again repeated his tale.  The Cadi asked what witnesses he had.  Ali
Cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution, as he had
considered the man his friend, and up to that time had always found him
honest.

The merchant, on his side, stuck to his story, and offered to swear
solemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand gold pieces,
but that he did not even know they were there.  The Cadi allowed him to
take the oath, and pronounced him innocent.

Ali Cogia, furious at having to suffer such a loss, protested against
the verdict, declaring that he would appeal to the Caliph,
Haroun-al-Raschid, himself.  But the Cadi paid no attention to his
threats, and was quite satisfied that he had done what was right.

Judgment being given the merchant returned home triumphant, and Ali
Cogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the Caliph.  The
next morning he placed himself on the road along which the Caliph must
pass after mid-day prayer, and stretched out his petition to the
officer who walked before the Caliph, whose duty it was to collect such
things, and on entering the palace to hand them to his master.  There
Haroun-al-Raschid studied them carefully.

Knowing this custom, Ali Cogia followed the Caliph into the public hall
of the palace, and waited the result.  After some time the officer
appeared, and told him that the Caliph had read his petition, and had
appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience.  He then
inquired the merchant''s address, so that he might be summoned to attend
also.

That very evening, the Caliph, with his grand-vizir Giafar, and
Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as was their habit,
went out to take a stroll through the town.

Going down one street, the Caliph''s attention was attracted by a noise,
and looking through a door which opened into a court he perceived ten
or twelve children playing in the moonlight.  He hid himself in a dark
corner, and watched them.

"Let us play at being the Cadi," said the brightest and quickest of
them all; "I will be the Cadi.  Bring before me Ali Cogia, and the
merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold."

The boy''s words recalled to the Caliph the petition he had read that
morning, and he waited with interest to see what the children would do.

The proposal was hailed with joy by the other children, who had heard a
great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly settled the part
each one was to play.  The Cadi took his seat gravely, and an officer
introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff, and then the merchant who
was the defendant.

Ali Cogia made a low bow, and pleaded his cause point by point;
concluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such a heavy
loss.

The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the merchant, and inquired
why he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question.

The false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchant had
given to the Cadi of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that he had told
the truth.

"Stop a moment!" said the little Cadi, "before we come to oaths, I
should like to examine the vase with the olives.  Ali Cogia," he added,
"have you got the vase with you?" and finding he had not, the Cadi
continued, "Go and get it, and bring it to me."

So Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and then pretended to lay a
vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his vase, which he had
given to the accused for safe custody; and in order to be quite
correct, the Cadi asked the merchant if he recognised it as the same
vase.  By his silence the merchant admitted the fact, and the Cadi then
commanded to have the vase opened.  Ali Cogia made a movement as if he
was taking off the lid, and the little Cadi on his part made a pretence
of peering into a vase.

"What beautiful olives!" he said, "I should like to taste one," and
pretending to put one in his mouth, he added, "they are really
excellent!

"But," he went on, "it seems to me odd that olives seven years old
should be as good as that!  Send for some dealers in olives, and let us
hear what they say!"

Two children were presented to him as olive merchants, and the Cadi
addressed them.  "Tell me," he said, "how long can olives be kept so as
to be pleasant eating?"

"My lord," replied the merchants, "however much care is taken to
preserve them, they never last beyond the third year.  They lose both
taste and colour, and are only fit to be thrown away."

"If that is so," answered the little Cadi, "examine this vase, and tell
me how long the olives have been in it."

The olive merchants pretended to examine the olives and taste them;
then reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good.

"My lord," returned the olive merchants, "we can assure you that the
olives are those of the present year.  And if you consult all the
merchants in Bagdad you will not find one to give a contrary opinion."

The accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest, but the Cadi
gave him no time.  "Be silent," he said, "you are a thief.  Take him
away and hang him."  So the game ended, the children clapping their
hands in applause, and leading the criminal away to be hanged.

Haroun-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the child,
who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself was to
hear on the morrow.  "Is there any other verdict possible?" he asked
the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself.  "I can imagine
no better judgment."

"If the circumstances are really such as we have heard," replied the
grand-vizir, "it seems to me your Highness could only follow the
example of this boy, in the method of reasoning, and also in your
conclusions."

"Then take careful note of this house," said the Caliph, "and bring me
the boy to-morrow, so that the affair may be tried by him in my
presence.  Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty from the mouth of a
child.  Bid Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives, and see that two
dealers in olives are present."  So saying the Caliph returned to the
palace.

The next morning early, the grand-vizir went back to the house where
they had seen the children playing, and asked for the mistress and her
children.  Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir inquired which had
represented the Cadi in their game of the previous evening.  The eldest
and tallest, changing colour, confessed that it was he, and to his
mother''s great alarm, the grand-vizir said that he had strict orders to
bring him into the presence of the Caliph.

"Does he want to take my son from me?" cried the poor woman; but the
grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her that she should have
the boy again in an hour, and she would be quite satisfied when she
knew the reason of the summons.  So she dressed the boy in his best
clothes, and the two left the house.

When the grand-vizir presented the child to the Caliph, he was a little
awed and confused, and the Caliph proceeded to explain why he had sent
for him.  "Approach, my son," he said kindly.  "I think it was you who
judged the case of Ali Cogia and the merchant last night?  I overheard
you by chance, and was very pleased with the way you conducted it.
To-day you will see the real Ali Cogia and the real merchant.  Seat
yourself at once next to me."

The Caliph being seated on his throne with the boy next him, the
parties to the suit were ushered in.  One by one they prostrated
themselves, and touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with their
foreheads.  When they rose up, the Caliph said:  "Now speak.  This
child will give you justice, and if more should be wanted I will see to
it myself."

Ali Cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the other, but when the
merchant offered to swear the same oath that he had taken before the
Cadi, he was stopped by the child, who said that before this was done
he must first see the vase of olives.

At these words, Ali Cogia presented the vase to the Caliph, and
uncovered it.  The Caliph took one of the olives, tasted it, and
ordered the expert merchants to do the same.  They pronounced the
olives good, and fresh that year.  The boy informed them that Ali Cogia
declared it was seven years since he had placed them in the vase; to
which they returned the same answer as the children had done.

The accused merchant saw by this time that his condemnation was
certain, and tried to allege something in his defence.  The boy had too
much sense to order him to be hanged, and looked at the Caliph, saying,
"Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now; it is for your
Highness to condemn him to death and not for me."

Then the Caliph, convinced that the man was a thief, bade them take him
away and hang him, which was done, but not before he had confessed his
guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali Cogia''s money.  The
Caliph ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out justice from the mouth
of a child, and sent the boy home, with a purse containing a hundred
pieces of gold as a mark of his favour.

It was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and most splendid of all
the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been spent by the
king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificent spectacles
prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival.  The sun was
setting, and the monarch was about to give his court the signal to
retire, when suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne, leading a
horse richly harnessed, and looking in every respect exactly like a
real one.

"Sire," said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, "although I make my
appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidently assure you
that none of the wonders you have seen during the day can be compared
to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes upon him."

"I see nothing in it," replied the king, "except a clever imitation of
a real one; and any skilled workman might do as much."

"Sire," returned the Indian, "it is not of his outward form that I
would speak, but of the use that I can make of him.  I have only to
mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and no matter how
distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find myself there.  It
is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous, and if your Highness
will allow me, you can prove it for yourself."

The King of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the
common, and had never before come across a horse with such qualities,
bade the Indian mount the animal, and show what he could do.  In an
instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired where the monarch
wished to send him.

"Do you see that mountain?" asked the king, pointing to a huge mass
that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz; "go and
bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot."

The words were hardly out of the king''s mouth when the Indian turned a
screw placed in the horse''s neck, close to the saddle, and the animal
bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon beyond the sight
even of the sharpest eyes.  In a quarter of an hour the Indian was seen
returning, bearing in his hand the palm, and, guiding his horse to the
foot of the throne, he dismounted, and laid the leaf before the king.

Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the
horse was capable than he longed to possess it himself, and indeed, so
sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to sell it, that he
looked upon it as his own already.

"I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was,"
he remarked to the Indian, "and I am grateful to you for having shown
me my error," said he.  "If you will sell it, name your own price."

"Sire," replied the Indian, "I never doubted that a sovereign so wise
and accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my horse, when he
once knew its power; and I even went so far as to think it probable
that you might wish to possess it.  Greatly as I prize it, I will yield
it up to your Highness on one condition.  The horse was not constructed
by me, but it was given me by the inventor, in exchange for my only
daughter, who made me take a solemn oath that I would never part with
it, except for some object of equal value."

"Name anything you like," cried the monarch, interrupting him.  "My
kingdom is large, and filled with fair cities.  You have only to choose
which you would prefer, to become its ruler to the end of your life."

"Sire," answered the Indian, to whom the proposal did not seem nearly
so generous as it appeared to the king, "I am most grateful to your
Highness for your princely offer, and beseech you not to be offended
with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in exchange for
the hand of the princess your daughter."

A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words,
and Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled with anger at
the Indian''s presumption.  The king, however, thought that it would not
cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a
delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince
broke in.

"Sire," he said, "it is not possible that you can doubt for an instant
what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain.  Consider what
you owe to yourself, and to the blood of your ancestors."

"My son," replied the king, "you speak nobly, but you do not realise
either the value of the horse, or the fact that if I reject the
proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to some other
monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone
but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World.  Of course I do
not say that I shall accept his conditions, and perhaps he may be
brought to reason, but meanwhile I should like you to examine the
horse, and, with the owner''s permission, to make trial of its powers."

The Indian, who had overheard the king''s speech, thought that he saw in
it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully agreed to the
monarch''s wishes, and came forward to help the prince to mount the
horse, and show him how to guide it:  but, before he had finished, the
young man turned the screw, and was soon out of sight.

They waited some time, expecting that every moment he might be seen
returning in the distance, but at length the Indian grew frightened,
and prostrating himself before the throne, he said to the king, "Sire,
your Highness must have noticed that the prince, in his impatience, did
not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order to return
to the place from which he started.  I implore you not to punish me for
what was not my fault, and not to visit on me any misfortune that may
occur."

"But why," cried the king in a burst of fear and anger, "why did you
not call him back when you saw him disappearing?"

"Sire," replied the Indian, "the rapidity of his movements took me so
by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my speech.
But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw, which
will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth."

"But supposing he does!" answered the king, "what is to hinder the
horse from descending straight into the sea, or dashing him to pieces
on the rocks?"

"Have no fears, your Highness," said the Indian; "the horse has the
gift of passing over seas, and of carrying his rider wherever he wishes
to go."

"Well, your head shall answer for it," returned the monarch, "and if in
three months he is not safe back with me, or at any rate does not send
me news of his safety, your life shall pay the penalty." So saying, he
ordered his guards to seize the Indian and throw him into prison.

Meanwhile, Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up into the air, and for
the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher, till the
very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains.  Then he began
to think it was time to come down, and took for granted that, in order
to do this, it was only needful to turn the screw the reverse way; but,
to his surprise and horror, he found that, turn as he might, he did not
make the smallest impression.  He then remembered that he had never
waited to ask how he was to get back to earth again, and understood the
danger in which he stood.  Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set
about examining the horse''s neck with great care, till at last, to his
intense joy, he discovered a tiny little peg, much smaller than the
other, close to the right ear.  This he turned, and found him-self
dropping to the earth, though more slowly than he had left it.

It was now dark, and as the prince could see nothing, he was obliged,
not without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the horse to direct his
own course, and midnight was already passed before Prince Firouz Schah
again touched the ground, faint and weary from his long ride, and from
the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning.

The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out where he
was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick darkness, he found
himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace, with a balustrade of
marble running round.  In one corner of the terrace stood a small door,
opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace.

Some people might have hesitated before exploring further, but not so
the prince.  "I am doing no harm," he said, "and whoever the owner may
be, he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed," and in dread of
making a false step, he went cautiously down the staircase.  On a
landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was a faintly lighted
hall.

Before entering, the prince paused and listened, but he heard nothing
except the sound of men snoring.  By the light of a lantern suspended
from the roof, he perceived a row of black guards sleeping, each with a
naked sword lying by him, and he understood that the hall must form the
ante-room to the chamber of some queen or princess.

Standing quite still, Prince Firouz Schah looked about him, till his
eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and he noticed a bright light
shining through a curtain in one corner.  He then made his way softly
towards it, and, drawing aside its folds, passed into a magnificent
chamber full of sleeping women, all lying on low couches, except one,
who was on a sofa; and this one, he knew, must be the princess.

Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her, and saw
that she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld.  But,
fascinated though he was, he was well aware of the danger of his
position, as one cry of surprise would awake the guards, and cause his
certain death.

So sinking quietly on his knees, he took hold of the sleeve of the
princess and drew her arm lightly towards him.  The princess opened her
eyes, and seeing before her a handsome well-dressed man, she remained
speechless with astonishment.

"You behold, madame, a prince in distress, son to the King of Persia,
who, owing to an adventure so strange that you will scarcely believe
it, finds himself here, a suppliant for your protection.  But
yesterday, I was in my father''s court, engaged in the celebration of
our most solemn festival; to-day, I am in an unknown land, in danger of
my life."

Now the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah implored was the
eldest daughter of the King of Bengal, who was enjoying rest and change
in the palace her father had built her, at a little distance from the
capital.  She listened kindly to what he had to say, and then answered:

"Prince, be not uneasy; hospitality and humanity are practised as
widely in Bengal as they are in Persia.  The protection you ask will be
given you by all.  You have my word for it."  And as the prince was
about to thank her for her goodness, she added quickly, "However great
may be my curiosity to learn by what means you have travelled here so
speedily, I know that you must be faint for want of food, so I shall
give orders to my women to take you to one of my chambers, where you
will be provided with supper, and left to repose."

By this time the princess''s attendants were all awake, and listening to
the conversation.  At a sign from their mistress they rose, dressed
themselves hastily, and snatching up some of the tapers which lighted
the room, conducted the prince to a large and lofty room, where two of
the number prepared his bed, and the rest went down to the kitchen,
from which they soon returned with all sorts of dishes.  Then, showing
him cupboards filled with dresses and linen, they quitted the room.

During their absence the Princess of Bengal, who had been greatly
struck by the beauty of the prince, tried in vain to go to sleep again.
It was of no use:  she felt broad awake, and when her women entered the
room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted, and what
they thought of him.

"Madame," they replied, "it is of course impossible for us to tell what
impression this young man has made on you.  For ourselves, we think you
would be fortunate if the king your father should allow you to marry
anyone so amiable.  Certainly there is no one in the Court of Bengal
who can be compared with him."

These flattering observations were by no means displeasing to the
princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she merely
said, "You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to bed, and let me
sleep."

When she dressed the following morning, her maids noticed that,
contrary to her usual habit, the princess was very particular about her
toilette, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three times
over.  "For," she said to herself, "if my appearance was not
displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was, how
much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all my
charms."

Then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamonds she
could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all of precious
stones.  And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the richest
stuff in all the Indies, that no one was allowed to wear except members
of the royal family.  When she was fully dressed according to her
wishes, she sent to know if the Prince of Persia was awake and ready to
receive her, as she desired to present herself before him.

When the princess''s messenger entered his room, Prince Firouz Schah was
in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be allowed to pay his
homage to her mistress:  but on hearing the princess''s wishes, he at
once gave way.  "Her will is my law," he said, "I am only here to obey
her orders."

In a few moments the princess herself appeared, and after the usual
compliments had passed between them, the princess sat down on a sofa,
and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him an
audience in her own apartments.  "Had I done so," she said, "we might
have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs, who has
the right to enter whenever it pleases him, whereas this is forbidden
ground.  I am all impatience to learn the wonderful accident which has
procured the pleasure of your arrival, and that is why I have come to
you here, where no one can intrude upon us.  Begin then, I entreat you,
without delay."

So the prince began at the beginning, and told all the story of the
festival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia, and of the splendid
spectacles celebrated in its honour.  But when he came to the enchanted
horse, the princess declared that she could never have imagined
anything half so surprising.  "Well then," continued the prince, "you
can easily understand how the King my father, who has a passion for all
curious things, was seized with a violent desire to possess this horse,
and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it.

"The man''s answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when I tell
you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess my sister;
but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked, and I was beside
myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my father could not make up
his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it deserved.  I tried to
argue with him, but in vain.  He only begged me to examine the horse
with a view (as I quite understood) of making me more sensible of its
value."

"To please my father, I mounted the horse, and, without waiting for any
instructions from the Indian, turned the peg as I had seen him do.  In
an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker than an arrow could fly,
and I felt as if I must be getting so near the sky that I should soon
hit my head against it!  I could see nothing beneath me, and for some
time was so confused that I did not even know in what direction I was
travelling.  At last, when it was growing dark, I found another screw,
and on turning it, the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth.  I
was forced to trust to chance, and to see what fate had in store, and
it was already past midnight when I found myself on the roof of this
palace.  I crept down the little staircase, and made directly for a
light which I perceived through an open door--I peeped cautiously in,
and saw, as you will guess, the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor.  I
knew the risks I ran, but my need was so great that I paid no attention
to them, and stole safely past your guards, to the curtain which
concealed your doorway.

"The rest, Princess, you know; and it only remains for me to thank you
for the kindness you have shown me, and to assure you of my gratitude.
By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I have only my
heart, that is my own, to offer you.  But what am I saying?  My own?
Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment I beheld you!"

The air with which he said these words could have left no doubt on the
mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms, and the blush
which mounted to her face only increased her beauty.

"Prince," returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to speak,
"you have given me the greatest pleasure, and I have followed you
closely in all your adventures, and though you are positively sitting
before me, I even trembled at your danger in the upper regions of the
air!  Let me say what a debt I owe to the chance that has led you to my
house; you could have entered none which would have given you a warmer
welcome.  As to your being a slave, of course that is merely a joke,
and my reception must itself have assured you that you are as free here
as at your father''s court.  As to your heart," continued she in tones
of encouragement, "I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long
ago, to some princess who is well worthy of it, and I could not think
of being the cause of your unfaithfulness to her."

Prince Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no lady with
any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entrance of one of the
princess''s attendants, who announced that dinner was served, and, after
all, neither was sorry for the interruption.

Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and the table was covered
with delicious fruits; while during the repast richly dressed girls
sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments.  After the prince and
princess had finished, they passed into a small room hung with blue and
gold, looking out into a garden stocked with flowers and arbutus trees,
quite different from any that were to be found in Persia.

"Princess," observed the young man, "till now I had always believed
that Persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely gardens than any
kingdom upon earth.  But my eyes have been opened, and I begin to
perceive that, wherever there is a great king he will surround himself
with buildings worthy of him."

"Prince," replied the Princess of Bengal, "I have no idea what a
Persian palace is like, so I am unable to make comparisons.  I do not
wish to depreciate my own palace, but I can assure you that it is very
poor beside that of the King my father, as you will agree when you have
been there to greet him, as I hope you will shortly do."

Now the princess hoped that, by bringing about a meeting between the
prince and her father, the King would be so struck with the young man''s
distinguished air and fine manners, that he would offer him his
daughter to wife.  But the reply of the Prince of Persia to her
suggestion was not quite what she wished.

"Madame," he said, "by taking advantage of your proposal to visit the
palace of the King of Bengal, I should satisfy not merely my curiosity,
but also the sentiments of respect with which I regard him.  But,
Princess, I am persuaded that you will feel with me, that I cannot
possibly present myself before so great a sovereign without the
attendants suitable to my rank.  He would think me an adventurer."

"If that is all," she answered, "you can get as many attendants here as
you please.  There are plenty of Persian merchants, and as for money,
my treasury is always open to you.  Take what you please."

Prince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on the part
of the princess, and was much touched by it.  Still his passion, which
increased every moment, did not make him forget his duty.  So he
replied without hesitation:

"I do not know, Princess, how to express my gratitude for your obliging
offer, which I would accept at once if it were not for the recollection
of all the uneasiness the King my father must be suffering on my
account.  I should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon
me, if I did not return to him at the first possible moment.  For,
while I am enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses,
he is, I am quite convinced, plunged in the deepest grief, having lost
all hope of seeing me again.  I am sure you will understand my
position, and will feel that to remain away one instant longer than is
necessary would not only be ungrateful on my part, but perhaps even a
crime, for how do I know if my absence may not break his heart?

"But," continued the prince, "having obeyed the voice of my conscience,
I shall count the moments when, with your gracious permission, I may
present myself before the King of Bengal, not as a wanderer, but as a
prince, to implore the favour of your hand.  My father has always
informed me that in my marriage I shall be left quite free, but I am
persuaded that I have only to describe your generosity, for my wishes
to become his own."

The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanation
offered by Prince Firouz Schah, but she was much disturbed at his
intention of departing at once, for she feared that, no sooner had he
left her, than the impression she had made on him would fade away.  So
she made one more effort to keep him, and after assuring him that she
entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father, begged him to give
her a day or two more of his company.

In common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this request, and
the princess set about inventing every kind of amusement for him, and
succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost unnoticed, in
balls, spectacles and in hunting, of which, when unattended by danger,
the princess was passionately fond.  But at last, one day, he declared
seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer, and entreated her
to put no further obstacles in his way, promising at the same time to
return, as soon as he could, with all the magnificence due both to
