One hot June afternoon, a group of ponies with
their foals and yearlings stood on the edge of a
tableland or âplainâ in the New Forest. The
ground about them was covered with stunted
heather and fern, with here and there patches of
moss and bare white gravel showing the poverty
of the soil.

Beyond the company was a great expanse of
blue sky flecked with pinkish cloudlets, and, on
the horizon, blue and violet wooded heights, a
crinkly contour denoting oak and beech and an
evenly serrated line, plantations of firs. As
everyone who has journeyed from Southampton
to Bournemouth by road or rail knows, a great
part of the forest is open heath or moorland; but,
unlike the barren wilds of the Highlands, the New
Forest has also extensive woods full of gigantic
oaks and beeches, while the open ground in
many places is becoming choked with self-sown
firs.

Therefore, looking into the distance, the masses
of woodland largely concealed the open spaces.
Emery Down showed on the horizon, the sun fell
on the spire of Lyndhurst Church, and in the
middle distance a white curving ribbon showed
itself as a forest road, before it was lost among the
trees.

Below the ponies was a wide valley, covered
with coarse grass, and dotted with hollies, gorse
and stunted firs. The mares had chosen the
hill for their afternoon siesta because up there
were fewer flies and biting torments than down
below in the swampy bottoms, where, earlier in
the day, the ponies had been feeding. They stood
mostly in pairs, head to tail, so that the swish of
the latter drove the flies from their noses and
flanks. Once in a while, a yearlingâthat is, one
born the previous yearâfinding the sun too hot,
butted in between the mares.

The foals or âsuckersâ lay half-hidden in the
heather, wandered here and there nibbling at the
herbage, or drew nourishment from their mothers.
These varied greatly in colour and size. The
tallest was a black mare with the graceful lines of
the racehorse, as well there might be, seeing she
had some of the blood of that breed in her veins.
Next her stood an old white mare, bleached with
age, for, while the forest ponies exhibit the usual
equine diversity of hues, there are none all white.
In her prime she had been a grey, perhaps a
beautiful pearl grey with a few darker dapplings,
like her neighbour, a young mare with her first
foal, black of coat except for a white forehead
blaze and fore-foot. Close by stood, and dozed, a
chestnut mare with a mane and tail of pure gold,
or so it seemed in the sunshine. There were also
bays, with black manes and tails, but the commonest
colour in the group was a dark brown. It
was noticeable that most of the foals were darker
in colour than their mothers.

Standing by themselves were two dingy brown
ponies, a mare and a two-year-old, shorter of leg
than the other adults. Their necks showed little
of the arch of a well-shaped animalâindeed, both
ponies were almost donkey-like in shape, with
hollow backs, drooping bellies, and âcow-hockedâ
hind-legs. The mare had a beard hanging below
her chin.

Almost their exact counterpart, even to the
beard, had been set down, ages before, in the wall-paintings
and drawings scratched on bone of the
old Stone Age. These two, one might suppose,
were throw-backs to the old forest pony, which
was hunted, or possibly domesticated, by the men
whose remains were interred in the mounds dotted
over the forest. Indeed, close by stood a great
tumulus, and some way off was a group of nine
mounds, big and little, like parents and children.

Of the other ponies, several showed the
attempts at improving the breed practised of late
years. One had the short leg of the Exmoor
pony, another the tiny ear of the Shetland, others
the shapely line of the polo and even of the Arab,
for at one time or another all these, and others,
have been used as sires. In some cases the importation
threatened to improve the race off the
forest altogether. It is no land of milk and
honey, for the green pastures and lush spots are
not in themselves extensive enough to support
the stock of ponies, and only those which can
exist on the coarse tussock grass, the sweet but
prickly shoots of gorse, and the astringent
heather tufts, are sure of surviving. Also a good
proportion of the ponies stay out in the forest all
the winter; and though snow does not fall frequently
or lie long in this locality, yet the
weather is often colder than in the Shetlands,
where the little pony of the far North, his ears
buried in his shaggy mane, and a doormat-like
thatch on his back, winters without difficulty.

But here, at the other extreme of Britain, if
there come a long spell of bleak wet weather, and
especially if sharp frosts intervene, the younger
ponies are likely to suffer, and a man, seeing his
neighbourâs yearling looking âseedy,â will think
it his duty to inform the owner, who, unless careless
and improvident, will have the creature
âcaught in,â and give it shelter and food.

Perhaps the most striking in colour of the
group on the hill was a chestnut mare, of that
rich hue known as âliverâ chestnut. In the sun
her coat flashed bright orange-red, while by contrast
it appeared deep purple in the shade. Her
foal at the moment was lying in the heather, out
of sight. When at length he arose, one saw why
he could lie hidden so completely, for he was so
small and evidently had not long been born.
Compared with the other foals, which were now
well grown, though still leggy, the colt seemed
absurdly disproportioned, and with his big head,
long ears, and bent hind-legs looked, apart from
his colour, more like a fawn than a pony in the
making. His body was so meagre that it seemed
merely a connecting-link between his fore and
hind quarters. As he stood up he swayed to and
fro. His little napping tail looked exactly like
the strip of goatskin nailed on to form the tail of
those wooden steeds which were being made, not
so far away from where the ponies stood, in the
toy factory at Brockenhurst.

But the interesting thing about him was his
colour, for he was a âskewbald,â patterned
boldly in chestnut and white. Nearly all the
other foals were dark, and it was as yet almost
impossible to foretell their exact adult colour.
Alone among the youngsters, the skewbald foal
showed what his coat would be like when he was
full grown. Although so young, he possessed the
agility of young creatures which have no period
of sheltered repose, unlike fledglings in the nest,
or the young fawn hardly able to stand, and
hidden by its mother while it gathers strength.
In his way the foal was as nimble and alive as
young partridge or lapwing chicks. He trotted
to his mother, took nourishment with the curious
twisted neck characteristic of the attitude of a
foal when feeding, and relapsed from sight among
the heather.

Nearly all the mares had shaggy manes and
tails, and the hair hung down over their foreheads
so as almost to conceal their eyes. The
foals had manes standing up along their necks as
if they had been âhogged,â and their fore hair
rose in a curious tuft between their ears.

The ponies, to all appearance, were as tame
as any stable animal, and they would not have
retreated if a man had quietly approached them
or gone past at a distance of a few yards; unless,
of course, he had used a binocular or camera,
when the flash of light from glass or metal would
have caused them to start and make off. A horseman,
however, would be a different matter, and
they would have been on the move long before he
reached them.

At a nearer view the branding marks on the
mares and yearlings could be seen, mostly on the
back where a saddle would cover it, but sometimes
on the shoulder. These marks indicated the
initials or devices of their owners, commoners of
the forest, or Crown tenants, who have the right
of pasturing their ponies, the Crown demanding
a small annual sum for each animal put out in the
forest.

These marked ponies had the hair of their tails
cut curiously. This had been done by the
agisters, forest officers with numerous and complicated
duties. The forest is divided into three
districts, each served by an agister, and each
district has its own way of marking the tails of
the ponies registered by him. In one district the
lower third of the hair is cut away, leaving a
centre tassel; in the other two half the lower
third is cut off on the right and left respectively.
Thus an agister can tell at a glance whether a
pony belongs to his district or not. The cut tail
is, in effect, a receipt, testifying that the ponyâs
owner has registered it and paid the dues.

The lord and master of the herd on the hill, the
stallion, was not, for the moment, in sight. He
might have been cooling his heels in a stream,
dozing among the gnarled, ingrown hollies,
which, with their twisted branches, look fully as
grotesque as any of Mr. Rackhamâs picturing,
or have gone off to turn back a mare wandering
away down the valley.

Presently a shrill whistling call was heard, and
the mares showed signs of animation; ears were
pricked up and heads flung round. Up the hill
came the stallion with a pounding step. He was
a bright bay with a big white blotch on his back.
His forelock covered his white forehead blaze,
and his eyes also, for all one could see. The black
hair of his mane and tail was crimped or waved,
unlike the lank locks of the mares. He moved
with a vigorous action, lifting his feet high, and
with a long stride. He carried his tail with a
finer sweep than the mares, while his mane rose
and fell with the energetic movement of his neck.
His coat was glossy, and the high lights rippling
to and fro on the bright sienna surface were
golden in the sun and blue in the shade. When
he reached the summit he stopped, looking back
with twitching ears. He snorted and hurried to
the group of ponies, and past them, then stopped,
and the herd, understanding, prepared to follow
their leader, the mares calling to their recumbent
foals, which rose to their feet and stretched before
cantering to their mothers. The cavalcade moved
off, only the dappled grey remaining motionless.
She was wilful or lazy. The stallion took a few
quick paces back and touched her with his nose
as a hint to move on. She whinnied crossly and
tried to strike him with a fore-foot. He lowered
his head, bared his teeth and snorted, whereupon
she thought better of it, and moved off. The
stallion trotted to the head of the column, and
looked round to see that all were following.

As they went down the hill, two riders showed
on the ridge to the right, a man on a tall white
horse and a boy on a forest pony.

âLook, sonny,â said the horseman, âthat
was the stallion walking before us up the hill.
He has warned his mares and set them all going.
How fine they look in a bunch with their varying
colours! Seems a pity,â he continued, âthat
these fine creatures should have to go down into
the coal-mines.â

âNot a bit of it,â his father answered. âWe
should want a good reason to disturb mares with
young foals. The forest people would think us
very inconsiderate. Remember,â with a smile,
âyou may be a verderer yourself some day, and
sit in the court hall at Lyndhurst, where the big
stirrup hangs on the wall. Weâll make off to the
right and watch them as we go.â

As the ponies saw their supposed pursuers
getting further from them, they relaxed their
pace, stopped, and fell to grazing.

Only the stallion, still suspicious, kept his head
up, and trotted a little way towards the receding
figures, watching the intruders until they disappeared
behind a rise.

Then he turned and walked to the little stream
in which some of the ponies were standing,
fetlock-deep, or drinking.

During July the herd wandered over moor and
âplainâ or in the woods, keeping to their unmarked,
though to them fairly well-defined,
territory of several square miles. Outside those
limits were other herds, with their leaders ready
to take offence at the presence of strange
males.

The little skewbald foal kept away from the
other youngsters, for they were too big and
strong for him to play with; but by good fortune
a brown mare with a colt of the same colour, and
about the same age as Skewbald, joined the party.
What with milk and nibblings of heather and the
lush grass of the bottoms, the little foals grew
apace and became playmates.

In the late afternoons before the long evening
feed, the pair would gambol with all the abandon
of youth, while their mothers stood head to tail,
jerking manes, waving tails, shaking fore-legs,
and ever and anon changing the weight from one
hind-leg to another. The colts would race across
the meadow where the herd was pasturing, then
stop dead, and stand nose to nose, watching for
the otherâs next move; one would rear up suddenly,
startling his playfellow, and race away in
glee. Then followed a biting of manes and
nibbling of shoulders like any old couple. At
times they grew rougher in their play. They ran
shoulder to shoulder, trying to bite, or, rearing
up on hind-legs like veterans, indulged in an orgy
of make-believe biting and kicking.

But, for the greater part of the day, life went
quietly with the little foal. His mane, half white
and chestnut with a streak of black, was growing
fast. His barrel was filling out, and his legs growing
straight and strong. His slender muzzle poked
about everywhere, and his tail flapped continually.

In the hot July days, the colt and his mother
wandered over the hills, and by the little streams
meandering along the bottoms except where the
gurgling water was checked, and collected to
form a bog. Sometimes the stream was bordered
with birch and alder, growing in a soggy bed,
littered with dead wood, and choked with undergrowth.
Tracks ran in and out among the trees,
worn by the hoofs of generations of ponies.
Here, the deeper water flowed more slowly. One
afternoon, as Skewbald paused at the edge to
nibble at a bed of watercress, his mother snorted
at two curious objects moving on the surface of
the water, two bristling cat-like heads with small
ears and a swirling of water behind. They were
otters, steering themselves with their thick tails.

Once he nearly stepped on a snipe, her head so
far immersed in a muddy pool that she was not
aware of an intruder until the hoof was almost
upon her, and then what a fluttering and zig-zagging
and crying of âscape-scape!â Another
time, but this was next year, in spring, as he
dawdled around the edge of the wood among the
dead bracken, he nosed against a brown stem. It
moved, and suddenly became part of the barred
head and widely opened eyes of a sitting woodcock,
her buff, grey and white back matching the
dead leaves and bracken, and her long beak indistinguishable
from the stalks of the fern.

At one point the stream opened out into a wide
shallow with a pebbly bottom where the little
trout played. Tracks led into the stream and out
on the other side, for this was a forest ford.

How pleasant the colts found the water, enjoying
the splashing of their hoofs as they walked
in the stream, the while their elders stood fetlock-deep!
How refreshing to take a deep drink, head
and neck inclined at just the right angle so that
the nostrils were clear of the water, followed by a
snort of content!

After whiling away the hotter hours thus, the
ponies would take the tracks towards the hill.
As they got higher, the white stones showed in
the thin crust of soil, and the heather grew more
sparsely. One August afternoon, while rounding
a gorsebush which shaded a patch of bare blackish
soil, strewn with dead sticks and gravel, the colt
almost touched with his nose what looked like a
piece of dead wood covered with grey lichen and
spots of orange fungus, when, on the moment, the
thing came to life. The lichen and fungus
became grey-tipped and barred feathers, the
stalk-like projection opened in half, disclosing a
great, rose-pink, frog-like mouthâa mouth so
enormous and menacing, that Skewbald shrunk
back. Then the mother nightjar appeared from
nowhere, and croaking and spluttering she
fluttered right before the foalâs nose, so that his
attention was distracted from her young one. If
he had looked again he would have found the
gaping mouth and widely spread wings gone, and
the young chick again reduced to the semblance
of an unattractive lump.

Sometimes the ponies would take the open
moor with its coarse grass, scanty tufts of heather,
and sweet-scented bog myrtle. Much of it was
swamp, and the mare watched her offspring
to see that he did not venture into one of the deep
bogs known only to the forest men, and to the
ponies and deer. If he were rash, she called him
on to safety, while if he were obstinate, she butted
him with her forehead on to drier ground.

In places the moor was curiously patterned,
like a chessboard, a tuft of heather next a patch
of bare soil. This was owing to the peat-cutting,
a right possessed by the commoners, who, however,
are required âto cut one and leave two,â
so that the soil should not be deprived altogether
of vegetable growth.

In early September the colt may have seen the
forest gentian, a single blossom of a beautiful
violet-blue on an erect stalk, while the seed-pods
of the bog asphodel close by, of a vivid orange-yellow,
formed a perfect colour complementary.
But do ponies see colours? They apparently see
well by night, which would seem to show that a
large part of their retina consists of structures
adapted for nocturnal vision, just as the outer
part of the human retina only is used at dusk, the
inner being practically blind at this time, and
therefore green foliage and grass turn grey, and
red flowers appear black, red and green being
seen only with that part of the retina concerned
with diurnal vision.

About this time, too, as he crossed a sandy
forest path, he may have seen the brilliantly green
caterpillar of the emperor moth, its sides spotted
with pink, full fed, and wandering about seeking
a site for its cocoon. Was he able to detect the
same creature on its natural resting-place, the
heather, practically invisible to human eyes, when
motionless; its green merged into the leafage,
and the pink spots simulating heather buds?

Certainly the heather the year of Skewbaldâs
birth was of a brilliance such that the oldest forest
man declared he had never seen equalled.
Especially was this the case on the most barren
gravelly spots, where instead of the usual
magenta, clumps of the brightest crimson blazed
in the sun.

In the warm September days life passed
pleasantly. Through the cold, clear nights,
while Vega blazed above, he paced on with his
mother, ever nibbling, for, like his kind, he did
not spend the long nights in sleep, but towards
dawn lay down for an hour or so. His coat, fast
thickening, kept him warm, even when just after
sunrise a white frost covered every blade of grass,
heather tuft, and fern frond. As the sun rose
higher, the frost turned to a heavy dew in which
the colt wandered, the wet bog myrtle washing
him to the shoulder, while the rays, shining
through the mist, enveloped him with a golden
aura.

Later in the day he plodded up the hill on to
the âplain,â and while his mother dozed in the
shade of a clump of holly, he would roll in a patch
of brilliantly white or golden sand. Once as he
bent his knees to lie down, a grey-brown thing
like a dead furze branch suddenly galvanized into
life with a hiss. As the viper moved, the colt,
with a snort of astonishment, jumped all four feet
in the air at once, and the mother rushed towards
him. She saw the reptile gliding along the
path, and turned sharply away, calling the colt
to her.

So Skewbald learned to avoid a snake, and incidentally
that he could jump. He practised this
on occasion, leaping over fallen stumps, across
streamlets and shallow pits, not knowing how
useful an accomplishment it might prove to him
in after-life.

The waning of September, with its sunny days,
cold nights, and morning mists, made little difference
to the poniesâ daily routine. Apparently
they were as free to go where they listed as any
wild Western herd. But their owners kept an
eye on them, and left them there or had them
âcaught in,â as they pleased.

Later in the year strings of ponies would
wend their way to the Brockenhurst sales, but it
chanced that the owner of the bay leader of the
herd in which Skewbald ran, decided to have him
in before he got busy catching other peopleâs
ponies, which was always the case towards the
end of the year, as he was an adept at the game.

The shadows of a golden afternoon were
lengthening, and the herd, scattered over a mile
of valley bottom, was getting to work after the
midday siesta, when a horseman appeared on the
skyline at the head of the valley. It was the colt-hunter
seeking his property. A moment later
another rider came down one of the slopes, and a
third emerged from the woods bordering the
ridge on the other side of the valley. This last
was Mollie, a girl of fifteen, and the other a lad
of thirteen, her brother Tom. They had come to
help their father to capture the pony. This was
not the first time they had taken part in the chase.

The mares heard the thud of hoofs, threw up
their heads, and whinnied to their foals and yearlings.
Then a call came from their leader a good
way down the valley, and at once the ponies made
off towards the summons, increasing their pace
as the boy and girl riders came down upon them,
shouting and waving, in the hope of driving them
back, so that the stallion could be dealt with
alone. But the girl had to check, as she came to
a boggy patch, and they swept on to join their
leader. âGet along, Tom,â called the father,
following behind. âUp the hill, Mollie, and
head them off.â Tom, on a rough pony, and
riding like a centaur, raced after the fugitives,
which with one accord stretched into a gallop,
stringing out along the valley, according to their
ability; the stallion at the head, and putting his
best foot forward, as if he knew that out of all
the lot he was the one wanted. The ground
resounded with the thud of hoofs, manes and tails
waved in the air, and mares called to their foals,
the youngsters responding gallantly.

The stallion was making for a wood, and to
reach this the ponies had to skirt a swamp. As
the leader rounded the wet land, and made for the
upland shelter, Mollie came directly towards him,
screeching and waving. It was too much for the
ponyâs nerves; he turned and fled up the valley,
making for the higher ground, and followed by
the herd, somewhat confused and bunched together
by the check. Some of the foals began
to tire, and, with their mothers, slackened and
fell out. Among them was the chestnut mare,
who retired with her foal to the shelter of a clump
of hollies, whence, with twitching ears and distended
nostrils, they watched the pursuit. The
stallion, with some faithful companions, now encountered
Tom, who turned him again, and then
the man took up the running. Their aim was to
tire out the stallion, âto run him off his legs,â
for in this waste was no friendly farmyard or
paddock into which he could be driven. Grass
and heather fed, as he was, he was not likely to
have the staying power of stable-fed ponies. On
the other hand, he had no weight to carry, and,
if allowed to get into the woods, might elude his
pursuers until nightfall made it impossible to
continue the chase.

The mares, yearlings, and two-year-olds
dropped out one by one. In little groups they
watched the chase, pursued and pursuers rapidly
dwindling in size as they raced down the valley,
then thundering back along the ridge, black
against the evening sky. The bay had no rest,
and was turned time after time. Now and then
one rider slowed down, but the others kept inexorably
on the heels of their prey.

The chase was not without its dangers, for the
hillsides were dry and slippery. Once the stallion
fell, and rolled clean over, but was up and away in
a moment. The girlâs pony slipped twice, but
she stuck to him like a burr. The ridden ponies
had been on the business before, and were as keen
as their riders. They were quick to see the signs
of deflection on the part of their quarry, and
would of their own accord cut off corners to where
the stallion was heading. More than once the
boyâs pony, going straight for his objective, went
under a gnarled holly, and the rider had to flatten
himself, with his head buried in the ponyâs mane,
or he would have been swept off by the lower
branches, and hung aloft. But it was all in the
dayâs work. Perhaps the man took it the most
quietly. He was there to secure his ponyâhis
children were out for a good run.

The end came when the bay visibly tired, and
could no longer keep ahead. He was alone, for
all his companions had deserted him. The man
forged alongside, and the two ran almost touching,
when suddenly the rider, a halter in his hand,
jumped from his mount, and flung himself on the
stallionâs neck, bearing him to the ground. In a
trice the halter was slipped on, and the man was
up and on his pony, before the shaken bay knew
what had happened. It was a feat of strength
and agility of which few of the forest men were
capable.

The others rode up exulting in their fatherâs
prowess. âKeep clear of his heels, Tom,â was
the caution. As the stallion turned to make off,
the manâs mount leaned against the rope, bracing
herself against the coming jerk, which brought
the would-be fugitive up short, pulling him off
his feet. He was up in a twinkling, and lashed
out with his heels, but all were prepared, and
stinging whips warned him against these tactics.
When he hung back the two behind chivied him
on. Once he lay down and was dragged along
the turf a few paces, but the whips again drove
him up. Then, with ears depressed, the red of
his eyes showing, and bared teeth, he tried
biting, but a slash across the face intimated that
such an assault would not pay.

Finally, the stallion, dead tired as he was, lost
heart, dropped his ears dejectedly, and trudged
along, while his captors, almost as weary, went
homewards across the moors, now and then
breaking into speech, as they recalled the more
exciting moments of the hunt.

Of the stallionâs life in the coal-pits there is not
much to tell. This was a good mine, and the
ponies were well looked after. Their stalls were
lit with electricity, and they were properly fed
and groomed. When at work they wore leather
hats, so that in the low places a bump would not
injure them.

Once at least the stallion, who gained the
good-will of the drivers by his willingness and
activity, had a good rest, beside his weekly one,
for when the great strike was decreed and the
pony-men were called out, the ponies had to be
brought to the surface. The bay was among the
first batch, no longer bright of coat, and his eyes
dazzled by the light of day. But when he reached
the field of dingy grass, so unlike the clean
heather of his native soil, he lay down, and rolled
to his heartâs content, then got up and whinnied
long and loud, as if calling across the great open
spaces of the forest.

The ponies were changing pasture one bright
September day. They had eaten the grass from
a bottom sward, and the old white mare was leading
the party to another, a mile to the south.
Up the hill they went, in single file, the mares
with drooping heads, looking neither to left nor
right, the yearlings nearly as soberly, and the
colts wandering on either side to examine things,
like scouts on the flanks of a column. The ridge
attained, they followed the turf by the road. The
Isle of Wight, mostly cerulean blue with touches
of pink and gold where the sun caught it, lay
along the southern horizon; its hilltops alone
showed, the sea being out of sight, so that the
island seemed merely the last folds of mainland
hill country.

The old mare took the road, and the long string
of ponies, as they came on the hard, gritty
surface, suddenly became audible, the pounding
of their hoofs contrasting with their noiseless
progress on the turf. The road was straight, and
behind them a green-covered lorry approached
rapidly. It lurched somewhat, as if the driverâs
hand was none too steady. He had met an old
acquaintance in Hythe, and they had celebrated
the occasion. He held to his speed, being in a
foolhardy mood. Why should he make way for
ponies when they had all the forest on both sides
of the road? They must get out of his way, or all
the worse for them. But the ways of ponies were
fixed long before motor-lorries or any other of
manâs contrivances were in being, and the pace
of a car was beyond their calculation. Skewbald
was ambling behind his little brown friend on the
left hand of the road. The man kept to his side,
grinning in anticipation of the poniesâ sudden
dart to safety.

Some quickness of perception beyond the
ordinary, some electric rapidity of movement,
alone saved Skewbald. The increasing noise
and vibration warned him, and without stopping
to bend his hind-legs for a leap, he jumped with
all four feet sideways. The lorry, rushing on and
missing him by inches, caught the poor little
brown foal and hurled it into the ditch, its mother
in front escaping with a severe bruise on her
flank. The man involuntarily put on his brakes,
and the other ponies had time to get off the road.
He leaned out, and looked back. There was no
car, nor anyone in sight. âBetter get out of
this,â he muttered, and set off, cursing, accelerating
to top speed.

But he had looked only along the road. Tom,
on pony-back, was going shopping for his mother,
and, with his empty bags hanging from his saddle,
had taken a short cut across the moor, and by a
path through the trees on the hill. As he came to
the top the swaying lorry caught his eye. He saw
its check and the scattering of the ponies, then
its hurried departure. He cantered along until
he reached the spot where the brown mare stood,
and shrank in horror from the foalâs injuries, far
beyond his help, then with a hot urge within him
to bring the culprit to justice, he set off along the
road as fast as his pony could go.

A little later, a car with two officers and a
chauffeur came tearing along in the same direction.
As they neared the spot where the foal was
struck, the brown mare was seen standing in the
road. âSlow down,â ordered the senior officer
peremptorily, remarking to his companion that
there had been too many accidents to ponies that
summer. âPony hurt, sir,â said the chauffeur,
stopping the car of his own accord. One glance
at the foal showed that nothing could be done for
it, save freeing it from pain. The younger officer
got a revolver from the car, while the elder and
his man examined the tracks of the lorry before its
stoppage, and the pattern of the tyre impressions.
Then a shot rang out, and the mare moved away in
fright, but returned to the body as the car started.

When Tom reached the town he saw the lorry
outside a public-house. He looked up the street;
the policeman strolling along was an old acquaintance
of his fatherâs, and the lad went up to him.
âPlease, Mr. Jones, that lorry ran over a foal
back on the road.â âOh!â exclaimed the
constable; âsure? Whereâs the driver? In
there, I suppose. What happened?â At that
moment the man emerged, wiping his mouth on
his sleeve, and went to the lorry. âWhatâs this
about a foal?â asked the policeman. âYou
ran into it.â The boy burst in with, âYou
ran it down! You know you did!â âYouâre
a lying little rascal,â retorted the man surlily;
âI never went within a mile of a pony.â âI
know this boy well,â said the constable, âand
he wouldnât make trouble for nothing. I want
your name and address.â A few idlers strolled
up, and the man began to bluff; he was in
Government employ, and if his lorry with its load
wasnât in Ringwood by midday, someone would
have to answer for it. Just then the car with the
two officers came up. They jumped out and
looked at the lorry tyres. âThis is the car,â
said the senior officer. âWhereâs the chauffeur?â
Tom, the policeman, and the bystanders all
nodded accusingly at the driver. The officer
turned on him. âYouâre an inhuman brute,
running down harmless creatures. No, sir; donât
bluster,â as the driver opened his mouth. âWe
came up after you, marked your tyre tracks, put
the foal out of its misery, and we shall certainly
attend to give evidence against you. Take my
name, constableâGeneral ââ,â mentioning a
famous name, which made the crowd gape and
the miserable driver shiver in his shoes.

And later when he appeared in court, the
General, his subordinate officer, and the chauffeur
attended, as well as Tom, who was complimented
on the way in which he gave his evidence; and
the driver was severely punished, as a warning to
other brutal or careless people.

Wandering over moor and heath, and through
the deep woods, Skewbald while yet a foal got to
know the wild life of the forest, for, as with all
young things, life to him was more than mere
eating, and he was full of curiosity about everything
that went on around him.

In the evenings he would see the rabbits, first
little and then big, come out of their holes, their
white scuts flashing as they gambolled. If they
âfroze,â their quiet umber tint assimilated with
the surrounding hues, so that their outline was
lost, and sometimes the colt, going towards a
patch of herbage, saw nothing but a great black
eye gazing at him, until, on a nearer approach, a
young rabbit materialized, and loped away. On
summer mornings when the dew was heavy, the
bunnies looked almost black because of their
drenched fur. They would have all day to comb
and smooth it out underground. Early one
morning he saw a doe rabbit with a mouthful of
grass, sticking out on both sides of her muzzle,
like a great green moustache; she went below
with it, her two little ones following.

Hares he did not see so often, and they sat so
quietly in their âforms,â that he was not aware
of their presence until he nosed up against them.
But he once saw a hare anything but quiet. On
a bare patch of gravel near the railway, where
hares were in the habit of crossing, a big jack hare
was writhing and squirming without moving from
the spot, and Skewbald went up to see this
strange sight. The creature, of course, was in a
gin, though the foal was not to know that. Not
being afraid of hares, he got quite close, and, as
the entrapped one did not move off, but still
strained and struggled, he gave a mischievous
little stamp to drive him away. Now, the poor
hare was caught by a fore toenail only, and
Skewbald happening to press with his hoof on the
spring the jaw opened, and the prisoner was set
free; but his fore-leg was so strained by the
tension, that when he put weight on it, he fell
over, and squirmed as before.

Skewbald, very interested, touched him, and
the hare made off on to the track, where again
he fell and writhed, Skewbald watching through
the railings, until the noise of an oncoming train
reminded the stricken one that he still had three
legs to run on. The following spring Skewbald
again witnessed the hare in motion, and this time
there were two. The pair were on a level stretch,
and indulging in an orgy of violent movement.
They chased one another, turning and doubling,
taking turns to be pursued and pursuer, till one
stopped and crouched, the other jumping over its
back. Then they ran apart in tangential circles
which brought them face to face, whereupon they
stood up on their hind-legs, and thumped one
another with their forepaws like boxers. They
acted as madly as any other pair of March hares.

Instinct and his mother taught Skewbald to
notice all that was going on, to keep his eyes
âskinned.â When they were in the woods, the
harsh notes of the jays made him start, and from
his motherâs movements, he learned that someone
was about. Once in spring, browsing on the
young shoots of a hawthorn-bush, he almost
nosed against two dormice fresh from their long
rest, sleek and tawny bright, among the green
tufts.

The squirrels he could not help seeing, and
when he stopped, and looked at them sitting on
the low boughs of a fir, making short work of the
cones, they stamped peevishly with their hind-feet,
making quite a noise, as the rabbits did on
the ground. Once he witnessed a curious and
beautiful sight which lasted but a moment. A
squirrel pursued another, going round and round
a tree-trunk as they descended, so quickly that
they left on the eye the impression of a reddish
streak, drawn spirally round the trunk. This
again was in spring, and, like the mad antics of
the hares, a love chase.

Sometimes a fox trotted by, or sat up and
looked at him impudently, and, as it happened,
he got tolerably familiar with a family of foxes.
The lair was in a bank between the roots of an
old oak. Skewbaldâs mother, as she went by,
snuffed the air, and indeed, the smell, whether of
fox or high viands, was perceptible even to human
nostrils. So Skewbald snuffed too, and whenever
he passed the hole, the odour reminded him
of what dwelt there. One fine evening, as he
idled at a little distance, he perceived movement
outside the hole. It was not rabbits, so he went
closer, and saw the little fox cubs, lithe and furry.
One lay on its back gnawing at a moorhenâs wing,
two were engaged in a tussle, and one curled into
a ball with his tail over his nose, pretending to be
asleep; but when the vixen came up, and, after
looking round, sat down calmly amidst her
family, the mischievous cub got up, came behind
her and worried her tail, until she turned, and
seized him in her jaws, so that he yelped.

After this, Skewbald, when his company came
that way, looked out for the cubs, but he saw
little more of them, for the older they grew, the
later they came out, until it was night before they
emerged, and then it was not for play but work,
learning to hunt for their living.

Skewbald and his mother sometimes sunned
themselves by a bank crowned with lichened
thorns. It was quite a badger fortress, being
honeycombed with passages. A certain family
which camped by it one August must have occasioned
the badger some inconvenience, for they
used the great holes as dustbins, stuffing down
newspapers, tins, tea-leaves and coffee grounds,
and other rubbish. But they never set eyes on
him, not even on moonlight nights. Probably he
used an exit on the other side of the bank while
the campers were about. But Skewbald sometimes
saw him after dusk, coming or going with
his rolling gait, or appearing at the mouth of his
den with sniffing snout and uplifted paw. Once
the foal came upon him in broad day, and sunny
at that. He was fast asleep, nearly hidden in a
great nest of dried grass and bracken in a
sheltered corner.

Sometimes, though probably he was unaware
of it, the colt walked over little sharply pitted
tracks which were the slots of the deer. Only
once did he see that rare and shy British mammal,
the roedeer. Skewbald was strolling in a forest
ride, when, all at once, a delicate fawn-coloured
shape with two uplifted sharp horn spikes
emerged from a fern brake, and paused with
raised fore-foot and twitching ears before venturing
across the grassy space, and like a shadow his
mate followed him.

In the thick woods, he sometimes saw the other
deer, mostly fallow, the buck with widely branching
palmate antlers, but occasionally a great red
deer.

One September midday, mother and foal were
wandering down a wide drive in the woods, when
strange noises came to the foalâs ears, people
shouting, baying of hounds and blowing of horns.
He ran close to his mother, who, though not
alarmed, raised her head and snuffed the air with
interest. People with horns no longer hunted
ponies, and she had no apprehensions of capture.

Presently a buck topped the bank, and shot
across the drive, a mere rusty brown streak, gone
as soon as seen. The noise of the hounds wavered,
and grew fainter. The buck had eluded them.
Then in the distance a huntsman appeared
coming up the drive on a tall white horse. He
was a fine sight in his black velvet cap, dark green
coat with brass buttons, and his horn ready to
hand. He stopped by a gate watching the drive,
not knowing he was too late. On the hill out of
sight were the three men in brown velveteen, each
holding a team of the leashed hounds; young and
swift these, waiting to be put on the track of the
quarry when the slow old hounds, or âtufters,â
had got the scent, and mounted hunting folk waiting
or patrolling the forest glades. But the noise
and the sight of the buck was all that Skewbald
experienced, that day, of a forest buck-hunt.

After being warned by his mother, Skewbald
kept as respectful a distance from harmless grass-snakes
and slow-worms as from vipers. He even
jumped when the little brown lizard ran across
the path in front of him. And doubtless he sometimes
found the open door of the home of the
underground wasp, and quickly removed his nose
and himself from its proximity. More rarely he
saw the brown paperish globe of the wood-wasp
hung from a low branch, with a hovering swarm
of wasps like a yellow halo round it.

As for âstoats,â heathflies, and the tickling,
crawling New Forest fly, they are, in hot
weather, the torment of a forest ponyâs life, and
the less said about them the better.

Of birds, he knew most familiarly the stonechat,
always on the topmost spray of a gorsebush, both
in summer and in winter, with his little jerking
tail and monotonous âtick-tackâ note. Sometimes
he would see the stonechatâs relative, the
wheatear, standing on a stone or clod of earth,
with the same flirting of the tail; the attitude alert
and vigilant, his black eye-streak emphasizing his
suspicious glance.

In the evening he heard the âhoo-hooâ of the
tawny owl, and might have seen him sitting upright
on the low branch of a willow, close to the
trunk; and once in broad daylight, as he was
nibbling at the bark of the branches of a stubby
hollow holly, a blotched form appeared at the
opening as if in response to the noise he made
before her door; then with a couple of wing-beats,
the little owl flew up into the higher branches and
looked at him with fierce gold-rimmed eyes, and
irritable movements of her head.

Now and then he came across a small covey of
partridges dusting themselves in a sandy patch,
or sunning on a bank. Once in May, as he put his
nose to a tussock, a sitting partridge gave it a sharp
peck. All that season he looked into tussocks
warily, and one day he came upon what looked like
two partridges sitting together; but the one outside
the nest was a cock-bird, as could be seen by
his red ear-lobes and absence of cross-bars on his
wings. As Skewbald looked, a little head peeped
out from under his fatherâs wing and piped. Then
there was more chirping, and from under the
mother emerged a tiny chick, and in a moment
was lost in his male parentâs feathery recesses.
That faithful husband and father was on duty,
receiving each little chick as it hatched, and âdrying
them off.â

One of Skewbaldâs most interesting glimpses
of his bird neighbours concerned another family
party. He was standing one evening in June by
a great brake of gorse on a bank, near a little
stream, when he heard a flutter of wings, and a
great bird alighted, a shelduck, glorious in her
black, white, and chestnut plumage, crimson neb,
and coral legsâa bird which one associates with
the sandy shores of North Wales or the dunes of
Norfolk. Yet here she was, and after looking
round, she walked towards a rabbit-hole at the foot
of a gorsebush, put her head in, and vanished.

A little later the foal and his mother were drinking
at the stream very early in the morning, when
a subdued but anxious croaking was heard, accompanied
by a âcheepingâ from tiny throats, and
the shelduck came into view marshalling a long
line of the prettiest, fluffy, pied little ducklings,
negotiating all sorts of obstacles. And not one
parent only, for the father, larger and still more
resplendent than his mate, and quite as concerned
and anxious, brought up the rear of the procession.
Once or twice he whistled shrilly, as he
intercepted an errant ball of down, and sent it
into the right path. When they tumbled into the
tiny stream, at once the youngsters were at home
and self-confident. The drake saw them all afloat,
and again the procession re-formed to paddle
down-stream to the sea. What adventures were
they to meet with, and how many would the
parents bring safely to the seashore, to run along
the margin of the tide, in their pied down indistinguishable
from the foamy froth washing over
the seaweed? It was perhaps ten miles to their
destination, with many enemies in waitâhawks,
foxes, badgers, pike, and man.

Later in the season a naturalist, not a sportsman
or collector, armed only with his monocular prismatic,
passed the shelduckâs burrow, and a feather
caught his eye. He stooped, and picking it up,
scrutinized it closely. By its white, black and
chestnut, he knew at once from what bird it had
fallen and that doubtless this was her nesting site.

But perhaps one of the most thrilling sights to
be seen in the forest by a lover of birds was what
Skewbald first beheld one cold April morning. A
rough untidy yearling after his winter outdoors,
he wandered down to the brook, where on a
muddy patch broad three-toed footprints had been
freshly impressed. Loose feathers, white, black,
and brown, caught his eye, and as he sniffed at
them he heard a strange musical phrase, with a
humming vibratory timbreâ

Skewbald looked around, and on a little rise
crowned by a grove of birches were several birds
about the size of pheasants. Two were a deep
blue-black, and there were several smaller,
mottled grey and brown. The black grouse still
lives in the New Forest, though sadly depleted
in numbers, and what the yearling saw was
the spring assembly, or âlekking.â The two
cock-birds were going through some strange
manÅuvres. One which had been sitting in the
fork of a tree, with his beautiful lyre-shaped tail
showing to advantage, flew to the ground. He
drooped his wings, lowered his outstretched neck,
which, with every feather on end, looked twice its
usual size, then brought up his middle tail vertically
with the curved extremities hanging down,
so that from the front it looked somewhat like an
admiralâs cocked hat. His silvery-white undertail
coverts were raised, and expanded like a fan.
It was this view he displayed to the presumably
admiring hens, though as far as one could see,
they took not the least notice of their admirers.
Meanwhile he hummed the song already indicated.
Then the other bird came forward, got up
like the first, and the real business commenced.
With outstretched necks and distended crimson
eyebrows, they fenced with each other, until one,
taking courage, flew at his rival, and there was a
rough-and-tumble struggle, only ended when one
had had enough. Then the victor strutted about,
and renewed his song.

It was midwinter and âbad pony weatherââthat
is, the atmospheric conditions were likely to
upset the less hardy and the younger members of
the herds. For a month there had been a succession
of torrential gales from the south-west blotting
out the âWight,â so that the thickest pony
thatch was drenched, and when, as had happened
several times, a hard frost followed a heavy downpour,
the ponies suffered severely from cold, and
the youngstersâ constitutions were sorely tried.

Skewbaldâs mother sheltered herself and him
all ways that an old forest pony knew. In the
heaviest storms she took him to the shelter of
thick hollies or dense spruce groves, but even a
forest pony must eat, and in spite of wet, they had
to leave the protection of the woods for the open
ground, where most of their provender was
to be obtained. Skewbald, from some inherited
strength of fibre, suffered less than other
youngsters, many of whom were âcaught inâ
with their mothers by the more careful owners,
and given food and shelter.

The chestnut and her foal were among those
left out all the winter. Continued frost meant
little to them, protected as they were by their
thick coats. Skewbald, especially, had done his
best to keep himself warm. A great shock of hair
came over his eyes, his mane hung in a thick mass
on his neck, his tail nearly reached the ground and
kept his thighs warm, while his body and legs
looked half as thick again, from the growth of long
hair which covered him right down to the hoofs.
Only his nose was soft and velvety much as in
summer.

After a heavy fall of snow, the mare showed her
son how to kick and scrape away until the herbage
was reached. She taught him to nibble at the
gorse, hard and prickly though nutritious; with
retracted lips nipping off the spikes full of
aromatic buds, and grinding the prickles to shreds
before swallowing. When the foresters cut down
hollies, she was soon on the spot, showing the
youngster how to tear off the sweet bark of the
branches hacked from the poles.

On sunny mornings after sharp frost, he would
lie down in the bracken, tuck his legs under him,
and doze, warm and comfortable, for hours. If it
rained, he followed his mother, and learned the
trick of keeping his back to the wind, thus lessening
the surface exposed.

The agister riding across the moorland heard a
mare neighing, and when she repeated her call
several times, trotted his mount towards her. She
was a bay roan, and after another plaint ran a
little way, and stopped. As the rider came to a
clump of high gorse, he saw a foal lying in a
sheltered nook. One glance showed him it was
dead, a poor thin âsuckerâ with legs outstretched
stiffly. âShould have been taken in before,â he
muttered to himself; âthatâs the youngster I told
Sam Evett about a week ago. Some people arenât
to be trusted with animals.â On his way back he
came across first one and then another young pony
looking âseedy,â and these with their mothers
were gently guided to the nearest farmyard, where
they would be taken care of until their owners
fetched them away.

That night the weather became worse than
ever. The storm raged through the woods,
roaring in the pines and swaying the birches
and beeches, while dead branches snapped off
with cracks like rifle-fire. Skewbald and his
mother were sheltering on the lee side of a
giant beech. If it had been day, the trail of dead
oyster fungus up its trunk would have told its tale
of inner decay. The mare became uneasy, and
moved away from the shelter of the vast column.
She called to Skewbald, who followed, but feeling
the bite of the freezing wind, backed behind the
trunk again. There was a tremendous crack, a
tearing and rending, and the great bole snapped
off above the coltâs head, and crashed to the
ground, the trunk still poised at its line of fracture,
held by bark and sound wood, so that Skewbald
was untouched and unhurt.

A cold north-easter blew across the moor. The
old thorns were budding, the daffodils were peeping
from the turf, and the yellow of the gorse was
beginning to show, so spring was at hand, but
there were few other signs of it, for the season was
late. If the chiffchaff had come, he had no time
to make his presence known by song, his food was
all too rare.

The chestnut mare and her son wandered on
the sheltered side of holly and tall gorse, picking
up what they could. Skewbald, now termed a
yearling though not yet a year old, showed conspicuously
in the landscape in his chestnut and
white. But he was ragged and untidy to the last
degree. His doormat-like coat was torn and
tangled by conflict with the thorns. His face and
neck had the same patchy appearance. But for
the coarseness of his covering, his ribs would have
shown, for, apart from his not yet having filled
out, the severe weather had kept him âlight.â
His legs were still bony and ungainly, and he was
plainly in the hobbledehoy stage. But he had a
good gait, the bones of his shoulders and hind-quarters
were of great strength, with plenty of
room for muscular attachments, and when he
walked, he covered plenty of ground.

The ponies wanderedâwandered because they
had not time to stand back to the wind as do stall-fed
cattle, for both day and night was wanted for
finding sustenance.

The mare had joined a herd led by a small but
energetic stallion, whose shade of blackish-brown,
and âmealyâ or light-coloured nose, proclaimed
his streak of Exmoor blood. Unlike Skewbald and
other ponies, he had been looked after during the
winter, and having only lately been turned out
into the forest, was in splendid condition. He was
full of spirit, alert, and mistrustful of the unusual,
while as master of the herd he brooked no disobedience.
One day after the herd had drunk at
a favourite shallow, they were moving to another
feeding-ground, and the stallion, looking over his
company, noted the chestnut mare still standing
motionless. Either she had not fully slaked her
thirst or some old association made her reluctant
to leave. The leader walked to her and snorted.
She turned her head, but made no other sign of
acquiescence, whereupon he lost patience, bared
his teeth, depressed his ears, and made a little run
at her as if to bite, when she at once made haste
to comply with his command.

On the way, the party was joined by a young
stallion of a blue roan hue, with white forehead
blaze and pink nose, accompanied by an old bay
mare with her yearling. For a time, the three
having fallen in at the rear, all went well, but
presently the grey left his place, and went forward
as if for the express purpose of creating trouble
for himself, for the leader, by his depressed ears
and backward glance, showed that he considered
he had a rival in the field, and was ready to take up
the implied challenge. The grey was taller, but
not in such good condition, having been left out
during the winter.

The mealy-nosed stallion took to making little
rushes at the interloper with extended neck and
bared teeth. The younger at first contented himself
by retreating or swerving, but at last the touch
of teeth on his neck aroused his resentment and
combativeness. He turned sharply, and flinging
out his heels, kicked the leader on the shoulder.
It was the first real blow, and as if by signal, the
two reared up, and with fore-feet striking vigorously,
tried to bite one another on the face and
neck, until they had to come down to rest. Then
the little stallion in his turn reversed, and let out a
kick which took effect on his opponentâs hind-quarter.
The grey screamed with pain and fury.
Rearing, he threw himself at his enemy, knocked
him down, and, unable to keep his balance, rolled
right over him. The leader was up first, and
standing on his prostrate opponent, belaboured
him with his hoofs. The grey cried out under this
treatment, and when he succeeded in getting to
his feet, his adversary rushed at him with jaws
agape and bristling mane, so that he fairly turned
tail. Then the mealy-nosed one trumpeted shrilly,
shook himself, pushed past the waiting herd to
the head, and resumed the journey.

They crossed a road, and went down a rutted
path, and this for a few yards became a causeway
across an obviously boggy patch. The road had
been made by dumping gravel into the swamp,
its sides being strengthened by balks of timber.
Near the edges of the bog, patches of lush grass,
emerald of hue, were beginning to sprout. Skewbald
strolled down to sample this luxury, but was
recalled to her side by his motherâs sharp whinny.
She knew the temptation this verdant growth had
for youngsters, and its danger. A moment later,
a tragedy occurred. A poor-looking, black yearling,
motherless for some reason, strayed from the
path, to nibble at a tempting patch, a yard or so
from the edge. He walked confidently to it, but
after a mouthful, sank below his knees, and a cry
of fright broke from him. The herd showed signs
of distress, and shrill whinnyings came from the
mares as they plunged to and fro along the
margin; but the coltâs efforts to reach his companions
only involved him the more surely in the
morass.

A few bubbles rising to the surface of what was
now a muddy pool told of the disaster which had
occurred. The bog keeps its secrets, and no one
knows how many ponies have been engulfed in it.

Spring had come at last. The cold east winds had
been followed by warm south-westerly gales with
soft rain, making the grass grow and filling the
bogs also. The golden-yellow of the marsh-marigold
at the streamâs edge was repeated in a
lighter key by the stunted wild daffodils in the
forest meadows, and again in higher but more
diluted tone by the primroses on the banks outside
the woods. The blackthorn was past its prime,
but the bushes were still covered with blossom now
looking like soiled snow. The oaks and beeches
were still in bud only. The thorns had put out
tufts of vivid green, drowning the grey-green of
their lichened branches. In the swampy spots the
catkins of the bog myrtle shone in the sun with
extraordinary brilliance, presenting great patches
of that rare colour in wild floral natureâdeep
orange and orange-scarlet.

Of course, the birds were here. Not only the
residents, the stonechat and the little hedge and
field birds, and the rook, crow, kestrel, and heron,
but the migrants also. The chiffchaff uttered his
name continually as he hunted in the scraggy
budding oaks, the willow-warbler repeated his
wavering refrain, crescendo and diminuendo, very
like the bends in the âtailâ in âAlice in Wonderland;â
and the whitethroat was beginning to
throw himself in ecstasy above the bushes. The
blackcap flew from bough to bough, as he shrilled
his wild, inconsequent, yet melodious and captivating
song, while the garden-warbler skulked in the
bushes, chuckling and fluting throatily at great
length; the nightingale began to âjug,â while
his shorter but more richly coloured mate industriously
collected oak-leaves for her nest. In the
beechwoods the woodwren flitted from bough to
bough, repeating his clear call, followed by a
twittering cadence like ice tinkling in a glass,
while his wings quivered in time with his tune.

Above the moor the cock lapwing made occasional
flights to amuse his sitting partner, flapping
his rounded wings vigorously as he flew all ways,
curving downwards to the ground without alighting
and up again in another sweep, then âreversingâ
in his characteristic way. Meanwhile
the redshank stood on the bog bobbing his head
nervously, or whistled shrilly to his mate, if a crow
or a man appeared on the horizon. The redshank
likes to nest near the lapwing, which is as brave as
the other is timid, dashing threateningly down on
an intruder, especially its ancient enemiesâcrow,
jackdaw, and harrier.

Out on the moor lawns of green grass showed
amongst the heather, and in the bogs, amidst the
bleached tussock grass, were patches of new grass
of the most vivid emerald, looking, and most deceptively
so, like firm sward.

There are many bogs in the forest, varying from
patches a few yards square to huge ones covering
many acres. In Denny Bog still lie the
remains of an aeroplane which landed on the
smooth and, to an eye looking from above, apparently
firm surface. The pilot, on getting out
of the fuselage, was soon up to his waist; and
in spite of repeated efforts, it was found impossible
to extricate the plane, and the salvers
had to content themselves with removing the
engine.

To the human visitor the bog has no terrors, for
its dead yellowish grass with green patches and
occasional pools proclaim its nature. Moreover,
causeways of gravel have been made across
narrower parts where necessary.

Skewbald and his mother were wandering as
usual on the moor, the rest of the herd strung out
over a square mile of forest, hillside, and grass
bottom, too intent on making up for their scanty
winter fare to desire the close companionship of
their fellows.

Skewbald was much the same as a month before,
perhaps a little more ragged, as his loosening
winter dress got carded out by the thorns.

The two were on the outskirts of a great bog,
to the south of which extensive woods filled the
horizon. They were not alone. A little distance
away two gipsies, a man and a boy, were following
the edge of the bog, striding from tussock to
tussock and probing with their sticks for bad
places which might let them in.

There was no difficulty in divining what they
wanted. The lapwings screaming overhead, the
redshanks wailing as they flew right away, knew
also that their eggs were in danger. Ploversâ eggs
are part of the gipsyâs livelihoodâto sell, because
they are too precious for him to eat. He would
say that he found far more in a henâs egg.

As the egg-hunters quartered the ground, they
approached the ponies, which, judging from their
movements that they themselves were not likely
to be molested, ignored their proximity. The
boy, when abreast of Skewbald, suddenly raised
his stick, and from pure mischief or rather fun,
ran at the yearling, which, startled, bounded off,
but in the direction of the bog. He plunged about
and sank deeply, while his strenuous efforts to
extricate himself only caused him to become more
firmly embedded. Soon he could no longer move
his legs, the mud reached his flanks, and he was
still sinking, though now more slowly.

The man stormed at the boy standing open-mouthed
in dismay, then looking round began to
run, calling to the other to follow. He was
making for a promontory of firm ground stretching
into the bog. Here stood a few stunted pines
which a fire had caught, for they were black and
dead, some already lying on the ground. Both
loaded themselves with the fallen logs, staggered
back to the yearling, and began to throw the wood
on the bog towards him. Skewbald, incapable of
motion save for frenzied movements of his head
and neck, was aghast at his plight, and called
piteously to his mother, who plunged backwards
and forwards along the edge of the bog, whinnying
distractedly.

The man waded out and pushed log after log
under the yearlingâs belly. Then he got a pole
under him behind the fore-legs. His next action
was to bend down and feel in the mud to ascertain
if the ponyâs legs were straight. A forcible pull
on a bent leg might cause a fracture. His preparations
made, he put all his strength into levering
up the pole, calling: âNow, Jarge, let âun have
what for;â and the boy, with a stick, belaboured
the yearlingâs hind-quarters. Skewbald felt himself
moved by the manâs force, and, under the
added stimulus of pain, made tremendous exertions.
The man made another effort, and a fore-leg
came up. âAt âun again, lad;â and the
harassed yearling, with a great heave and an explosive
âsuck,â came out of the mud and began to
flounder towards the firm ground, leaving the two
half-bogged themselves. The man reached out
and pulled the boy towards him, and they worked
their way out.

They were covered with mud from head to foot,
and regarded each other doubtfully, until the
man laughed (a smile would not have been perceived),
whereupon the boy exploded in peals of
merriment. Their hearts were warm within
them, with the pleasure of success, for horseflesh
or ponyflesh is dear to the gipsy. Then, picking
up the eggs they had collected, which, being
gipsies, they had carefully deposited in a tussock,
they departed.

But Skewbald carried a long scar on his belly,
caused by a sharp pine knot, to the day of his
death.

It was full spring. For nearly a month May had
flooded the forest with sunlight. The gold of the
gorse was blinding to the eye, and almost intoxicating
with its strong scent of burnt almonds. The
powdery snow of the blackthorn had been followed
by the ropy, pinkish bloom of the hawthorn. The
foliage of the scraggy oaks was Italian pink (which
is a greenish yellow), while the silver birches and
the beeches had burst into leaf and emerald
tassels had succeeded the crimson buds of the
larches. The brambles had two distinct sets of
leafage, those of last year, old and tattered,
but magnificently blotched with crimson and
orange, and edged with sienna, while from
their axils sprays of tender green unfolded
themselves.

This is the month of song, and everywhere the
larks and meadow-pipits rose in the air, the former
to go up out of sight still trilling, while the latter
ceased singing, and came floating down silently
like parachutes of brown paper.

The lapwing chicks peeped from their motherâs
wings, or crawled over her back like the young of
the domestic hen. If an enemy flew over, the
male bird rose in the air in a frenzy of militant
defence, while at the parentsâ warning call, the
chicks crouched and became, to the casual glance,
invisible.

As for the pony population of the forest, it
seemed to have doubled in numbers all at once, for
everywhere the young foals followed the mares,
or lay basking among the heather. The early foals
were now tall and long-legged, though here and
there a late arrival stood unsteadily with bent
hind-legs, or trotted a few paces with a stiff-legged
gait. It might even essay a gallop, a curiously
mechanical action, reminding one of a rocking-horse.

One mare, at least, had two little suckers, and
here and there quite a family procession passed,
of mare, two-year-old, yearling, and foal, the
property of someone who had not troubled to sell
the youngsters, preferring to leave them in
the forest to breed. Parties of threeâmare,
yearling, and suckerâwere quite common, the
two youngsters on the best of terms.

The hues of the new-comers were sometimes
exactly those of their mothers, but often quite
different. An old mare, once a grey but now dirty
white, was followed by a black foal; if the latter
were closely scrutinized its eyebrows might be
seen to be grey, and that would mean the foal
would turn grey like its mother, and again white
in old ageâfrom black to white. But if the eyebrows
were black like the rest of the body, then
probably the hue would remain black or very dark,
for black is rare in the forest, and as some think
due to importation of alien blood. In the case of
one chestnut foal, its darker eyebrows showed
that when adult its coat would be of a rich liver
colour.

The majority of the foals bid fair to be like their
parents, a dark brown with blackish mane and tail,
and the same similarity existed with bays and
chestnuts, though generally the foals were darker
in hue than their mothers.

But there were exceptions to this. A dappled
grey mare, for instance, instead of the more usual
black-coated offspring, might be accompanied by
a foal, light fawn as to ground tint, with black
markings round its eyes and muzzle; or a dark
mare be seen with a light-coloured youngster.

The yearlings, among whom Skewbald was one,
had shed their winter coat by dint of rubbing
against bushes below and overhanging branches
above. The bay and chestnut showed clearly, and
the lights began to appear on their coats, golden
in the sun, blue in the shade, though they could
scarcely be said to âripple,â for the youngsters
were still bony, with unfilled barrels.

Young Skewbald was not amongst the dullest
hued of his fellows. There were few whose chestnut
was brighter than his, while his white could
not be matched anywhere among the ponies
except for an occasional âsockâ or forehead blaze
too small in area to tell at a distance.

Like the others of his year, he walked sedately,
for his hours of coltish play were over. Never
again would he gambol on the lawns with a playmate
in the golden evenings, though occasionally
he would lie down and roll, a pleasure every horse
and pony indulges in till the end of its days.
Sufficient for the day was the labour of filling his
belly, although the forest fare increased daily in
bulk and sweetness.

Three ponies were grazing on a long level stretch
of moorland one perfect evening in early September.
To the north were low hills, their sides
covered with purple heather and fern, the latter
already showing orange amongst the green. Here
and there an old thorn or holly dotted the hillside,
the ridge itself serrated by groups of firs. Along
the southern border of the moor flowed a tiny
stream, a few feet across, which, a few miles
farther down, would expand into a wide estuary
dotted with yachts.

As the sun declined, the moor fell into shade,
but on the hill the red trunks of the firs and the
orange of the fern glowed with richer hues, while
the heather added a ruddy tone to its purple. The
foliage took on that rich golden-green which landscape
painters love, while the shadows, deriving
their colour from the blue of the eastern sky, were
glaucous green.

Skewbald, still a yearling although some sixteen
months old, was with his mother, who had also by
her side her last foal, a brown filly. She was well
grown, for she had been born early in April.

As they grazed, Tom and Molly, followed by
their father, rode through the gate which led to
the little farm beyond the river. âThere they
are,â said the boyââmare, yearling, and colt.â
(New Forest folk have a way of referring to a foal
as a colt, even speaking of âhorse coltsâ and
âfilly colts.â) âYes, close at hand,â said his
father; âpush the gate wide open. I hope,â he
continued, âas we havenât all day to catch the
yearling in, that youâll just get quickly to work,
and remember catching ponies is one thing, and
running races with them quite another.â Tom
grinned, but in his heart hoped the ponies would
not let themselves be driven in without a run.

The father sent his boy along by the river, while
he himself made a detour to get behind the ponies.
Molly was to go up the moor to be in readiness
in case of a break-away. The ponies were to be
driven through the gate over the wooden bridge
into the paddock, and, if it could be managed that
evening, right into the stable yard. The boy and
girl were to watch them, while the father drove
them towards the gate. All went well at first.
As the man emerged from the trees in view of the
ponies, the mare stopped feeding, looked at the
intruder, snorted, and trotted away with her offspring.
The rider followed, gently shepherding
them towards the gate, his assistants closing in on
either side. Unfortunately, the youngest boy of
the family, who, with a small sister, was fishing in
the stream, had succeeded in bringing a minnow
to land, and signalized his triumph with a yell of
delight, just as the ponies came towards the opening.
The mare pricked up her ears, swerved
sharply, and, followed by her youngsters, made
off at full speed across the moor in spite of all that
the hunters could do. The man laughed ruefully,
calling, âYouâll get your run, Tom; we must
try and get them in before night.â Tom went
like the wind, in shirt and trousers, and barebacked,
on a little rough pony, which knew every
foot of the ground. The fugitives got to a boggy
place, and had to pick their way, so Tom, running
wide, got behind a patch of firs, and came upon
the ponies suddenlyâtoo suddenly, for they went
away up the moor, the mare shaking her mane
and tail, Skewbald keeping pace easily, and the
foal doing wonderfully well. They went right
past the girl, though she tore off her hat, whirled
it above her head, and let off blood-curdling
shrieks. âAfter them, Molly,â called her father,
and the thunder of hoofs resounded, while the
setting sun gilded the heather, firs, and fern with
a deeper glory than before, and enhanced Skewbald,
as he emerged with the mare and foal on the
hilltop, then disappeared behind clumps of hollies,
or, a moment in shade, told dark on the skyline.
The wide, open situation, the sense of space, as
the retreating ponies diminished rapidly to mere
dots, the sweet scent of bruised bog myrtle, and
the clear light, made a scene less like rural England
than the setting of some cowboy story of
vast upland country in, say, Idaho or Arizona.
Only the great sierra background was lacking.

Molly managed to drive the ponies off the
moor, up the hill, along the ridge, and then turning
them, drove them down the steep forest road
across the moor towards the farm, Tom and her
father on either side, waving and shouting to
prevent a break-away. There was no trouble this
time at the gate, for with man and boy to right
and left, and the girl thundering behind, the ponies
were glad to dash through. âGot âem,â chuckled
Tom as he closed the gate. The others followed
at the poniesâ heels over the bridge. The gates
leading to the yard were open, and all was quiet,
for Mother had looked out to see how things were
going, and had taken charge of her two small
children. As it happened, the fugitives, instead
of turning off into the meadow, as they might
have done, went up the road, dashed through the
opening, and found themselves in the stable yard.
Molly closed the great sliding-door, while Tom
and his father, jumping from their mounts,
attended to Skewbald. As he was a lusty
youngster, and with his shaking mane and depressed
ears looked mischievous, they paid him
the compliment of treating him like a full-grown
stallion, and Tom was given the job of haltering
him, for practice. The halter was hung on the
end of a six-foot rod, and while his father drove
the yearling into a corner, distracting his attention,
Tom quietly slipped the loop over his head
and fastened the rope to a ring in the wall, before
Skewbald had time to show resentment at being
tied up.

âFetch the branding-iron, Tom,â said his
father. Mother had it on the kitchen fire in readiness.
Meanwhile the man got a sack from the
shed, and watching his opportunity, dropped it
over Skewbaldâs head, who, while objecting to it
very much, was so puzzled by the darkness, that
he ceased his straining and backing, and was
reduced to quietude. This bandaging the eyes is
not often done, only when it is feared a pony may
become obstreperous. Sometimes the yearlings
are driven into a stable with no space to kick in,
when the brander will reach over one pony to
brand the next.

Tom brought out the iron, which was like a
poker with a ring handle for hanging up, and the
branding device or letters welded to the other end,
and of course in reverse. Several such irons were
hanging in the stable.

There need be no shuddering at visions of red-hot
iron and sizzling flesh, for the iron when it
reached the yard was black, and to all appearance
cold. Yet it was hotâhot enough to destroy hair
growth where it was pressed, and leave a permanent
mark.

The man took the iron and held it for a moment
an inch from his cheek to test its heat. âJust
right,â he said; âhold him, Tom;â then firmly
pressed the iron against the shoulderâthe
shoulder, not the saddle, for Skewbald was one
day to go to the mines, where appearances do not
count for much, hard pulling and quick turning
being more highly rated. Skewbald did nothing
out of the way when the iron bit into his skin, did
not kick or try to rear; he just winced, and that
was all.

Then the yearling was released and turned out
into the paddock, where his mother and her foal
were awaiting him. The agister would be along
shortly, and Skewbald would be on hand for the
tail-cutting. This is also a delicate operation,
as a pony may launch an unexpected kick.
Generally, a large pair of scissors in hand, the
cutter quietly draws the lower tail hair towards
him with the crook of a stick. In a stable into
which a dozen ponies may have been driven,
perhaps for the first time in their lives, the agister
will venture fearlessly, and cut tail after tail without
mishap, trusting to the good sense of the
ponies, which will not kick in the confined space,
for fear of hurting their fellow-prisoners.

Occasionally, half a dozen commoners will agree
to meet on a Saturday afternoon, for the purpose
of collecting their ponies. The harness of the
ridden ponies varies in style, and is often more
homely than elegant. A man may be riding a
horse or pony whose accoutrements consist of
mere scraps of leather held together by string
and rope. The boys of the party ride barebacked,
or make an old rug serve as saddle.

Some time may be spent in rounding up the
ponies, which, after much hard riding and shouting,
are driven into a convenient farmyard, in a
bunch of twenty or thirty.

The quiet enclosure, tenanted only by a few
pigs and poultry, becomes a place of tumult as
the hunted ponies surge in, snorting, neighing,
and tossing manes, the pursuers close on their
heels to prevent a break-away. In a moment all
is life and movement. The poultry and pigs dash
hither and thither from beneath the trampling
hoofs. The riders jump from their mounts, which
with drooping heads stand passive as if glad to
rest, strangely contrasting with the restless movements
of the wild ponies, which, cowed and bewildered,
crowd into a corner, penned up so
closely that they have no room to kick, even if
they have the inclination; foals wander about,
seeking their dams; men and boys, leaning against
their steeds, chat with the daughters of the farm,
while dogs and children appear as if by magic, the
tiniest tot seeming to bear a charmed life. The
unwanted ponies are now sorted out, an operation
somewhat troublesome and delicate, and given
their liberty; the unbranded ones are tied up and
marked with their respective ownersâ branding-irons.

Then the company takes the farm road, leading
the freshly caught ponies. Most of the captives,
after a few skirmishes, submit to their fate, and go
quietly, but some, more resentful of their treatment
and unwelcome bondage, give much trouble,
both to their captors and to themselves. They
put down their fore-feet stubbornly, refusing to
budge, and when prodded by those behind, may
fling themselves down, to be dragged along the
stony road. An obstinate pony will try sorely the
patience of those in charge of it, and instances
have occurred of an animal causing its own death
by its violent resistance; but, generally, after half
a mile of rough treatment, the pony realizes that
further opposition is useless, and follows more or
less submissively.

October had been wet. Rain in the forest is, at
all times of the year, depressing. When the sun
shines on purple heather, emerald fern, and the
ruddy stems of fir-trees, moorland and hillside are
gay enough, but in wet and stormy weather the
landscape is the more gloomy by contrast; the
lowering clouds, the black sobbing pines, the
pools of water, the soggy tussocks squelching
underfoot, make up a dull and cheerless scene,
although in the eyes of the forest lover it is
perhaps then at its best. The damp atmosphere
intensifies the local colour, and gives a sense of
vastness and distance to the perspectives.

The forest ponies dislike rain. They have to
seek food most of their day, and cannot afford to
stand idly in shelter like their more favoured
relations. Also the boggy ground gets still more
shaky and uncertain, and the wary creature is cut
off from the areas which might supply him with
food. In long continued rain the ponies leave the
open moor or hillside, and betake themselves to
the woods, where, under the umbrellas formed by
the great oaks, beeches, and firs, they find shelter,
especially from what most living creatures detestâa
cold driving rain.

Skewbald, therefore, was with his companions
in the woods, nosing round for clumps of sweet
grass, or, in the wettest spells, taking shelter
under overhanging trunks. His coat had grown
thick during the autumn, and with his dense mane
and tail he was as well protected as a pony
could be.

The colt-hunter also disliked rain, for apart from
the discomforts of the chase in wet weather, rounding
up the ponies is vastly more difficult in the
woods. On the open moor the chase is not always
successful. Not seldom one may drive ponies
from miles away to within sight of the open gate,
and then something may arouse their mistrust,
may cause them to break away, and the work has
to be done over again. But, all things considered,
the chase on the moor is a picnic compared with
driving ponies out of the woods. In the open one
has the great advantage of being able to view oneâs
quarry from a distance, and formulate beforehand
a plan of campaign. But in the woods one must
search and search until the ponies are chanced
upon, and then stick tenaciously to their heels
until a capture is effected. In the denser parts,
one may beat about all day, and although the
ponies may be near, and even heard and seen, yet
they may change their ground so evasively that
night may fall and still find them uncaptured.

It was not raining much when the colt-hunter
and his boy rode out one morning, but the sky
gave every promise of a downpour later on.
âWet skins for us to-day, Tom,â said his father,
as he donned an old mackintosh, and a wide-brimmed
hat, which would divert the rain from
his neck. Like other people who are out in all
weathers, he had no use for caps, which in heavy
rain let the water trickle down oneâs back. Both
riders had bread and cheese in their pockets, for
they might be out all day, if they were not
fortunate in the chase. It had been arranged that
they should meet the agister, who wished their
help in locating and catching some yearlings and
older ponies. At this time of the year ponies are
caught in some numbers, and sent to the autumn
and winter sales.

The colt-hunter, by long experience and a
good memory for the forms and hues of ponies,
knew most of the many hundreds in the forest,
and their pedigrees. He was acquainted also with
the likely places where a wanted pony might be
found at any time of the year.

The hunters, with a cheery good-bye to Mother
and Molly, rode some distance across the moorland
and through the rides in the woods, skirted bogs,
and then made their way up a stone-strewn hillpath
to the south, past the spot where the young
airman, flying from the training-ground on Beaulieu
Heath, had stooped at a great white cross of
gravel, marked out on the hillside, and had nose-dived
to the ground, crumpling up his machine
and breathing his last in the arms of a visitor
camping near by. Father and son rode across the
barren plateau of Blackdown; to the east the
great tumulus stood dark and plain on the skyline,
but in front of them Wood Fidley was almost
obscured by driving clouds of rain-mist coming
from the south-west.

When they reached the main road, they found
the agister waiting for them. He had on his
buckled hat, but his official coat was hidden under
his horsemanâs cloak. He also foreboded bad
weather and a long drive through the woods.
They crossed the roadânow firm and smooth,
very unlike its stone-strewn surface during a dry
summerâtook a winding path over the moors,
and so into the woods.

The colt-hunter led the way into the deepest
recesses, where great oaks and beeches leaned
one against the other, while the ground was encumbered
with undergrowth. As they slowed
down to a walk, they saw ponies, half-hidden by
the bushes, stealing away. âThereâs one of
those weâre after,â said the agister, âand thereâs
another.â

Skewbald was not one of the wanted animals,
but of course he was not to know that, and made
off with the rest. It was now raining hard, the
wood full of driving mist, and the going very
heavy. The fugitives had the best of it, for the
ridden ponies sank below their fetlocks in the
wetter parts, while fallen branches, tangles of
briers and brambles, and drooping holly boughs
impeded their progress.

Tomâs pony, as keen as her rider, and not so
heavily weighted, made but little of the heavy
ground. She made straight for the fugitives
directly she heard or saw them, without waiting
for Tomâs directing hand on the reins, and several
times he was literally pulled from the saddle by
projecting boughs of holly, thorn, or oak. But
he held on to his mount, though torn, scratched,
and wet through. Then, when separated from
the other riders, he saw his opportunity, for he
came upon Skewbald and a wanted yearling which
had got away from them earlier in the day,
sheltering behind some dense holly bushes. Off
they went, with Tom close on their heels, and
after some amount of twisting and turning, the
fugitives came out on a grassy drive, with a gate
at the far end.

Skewbald made the pace for his companion, and
Tom put on a last spurt, trying to get even with
his quarry. Skewbald, as he approached the
barrier, glanced back at his pursuer, then, acting
under an overmastering impulse to escape, went
at the gate, cleared it, and was at once lost to
sight in a forest enclosure. Tom went right on,
charging full tilt into the other pony, which he
pinned against the gate, nearly knocking the wind
out of both animals. Before the yearling had
recovered himself Tom had him haltered, and a
safe prisoner.

In the New Year Skewbald again used his
jumping powers, and this time saved his life thereby.
He was feeding with two other young ponies
in a rough part of the forest, when a stray hound,
a deserter from the kennels, alarmed them. The
intruder, perhaps wishing for company, ran towards
them, but the ponies, not relishing his
advances, set off at a trot. The hound followed,
and the trot became a gallop. It chanced that
an artillery company, training in the forest, had
dug some pits which had not yet been filled in.
The ponies are, as a rule, quite able to take care
of themselves. They have a good sense of geography
and know the dangerous spots, as bogs
and pits, but, being driven away from the
training-ground, they were unaware of the existence
of the excavations.

As Skewbald fled, through gorse, tall heather,
and bog myrtle, the pony in front of him disappeared
with a cry, and, the next moment, he
found himself at the edge of a deep and wide pit,
with no time to turn. But the accident to his
companion had given him that fraction of a second
of preparation which was enough for his nerve
and muscle. He made a spasmodic leap, and just
managed to land his heels on the far side. The
third also leapt, but fell short.

When the hound, hearing the poniesâ moans,
looked down, he fled with a yelp of dismay. Later,
the huntsmen, searching for the truant, found
the two ponies, one dead and the other
grievously hurt.

In the rougher corners of the forest are the tents
of the gipsies, kept by authority as far as possible
from the more frequented beauty spots. One
comes across these encampments in little groups
of two or three wigwams, each being built on the
same principleâa framework of rods bent semi-circularly,
over which are thrown blankets and
any odd lengths of stuff that can be so used. At
one end is the âbaulkââa square tapering tower
of blanket or canvas open to the sky. This is the
chimney, the fire being built on the ground inside,
so that the inmates can prepare their food in the
dry, and enjoy the heat radiating into the tent
proper. Generally there is another tent beyond
the fire, so that the baulk is in the middle of the
erection.

On a fine Sunday, one sees the weekly wash
drying and bleaching on the bushes, children playing
with the dogs, the women cooking and the
men in their best clothes. Many before and after
Borrow, looking at the gipsy, have been impressed
by his fixity of type, his adherence to his mode of
life in a country gradually losing its open spaces,
and maintaining himself in face of restrictive and
sometimes oppressive regulations. To many the
standing marvel is that he can live at all outdoors,
not only in summer heat, but when frost is in
the earth, or when the ground shakes like a quagmire
and the ditches run like rivers. But nowadays
millions of men who came through the war
remember how in the course of their training, or
under the actual conditions of warfare, they slept
outdoors without even a gipsy tent, by fair and
foul, in wet and cold, and remember, too, their
astonishment that they suffered no harm, and,
bullets apart, thrived on the rÃ©gime.

But the gipsy has this in common with the town
dweller, that he, too, gets his living there; to the
town he must go to sell his produce or manufacture,
his flower or fern roots, his brooms, mats,
baskets, etc., and therefore a cart of some sort
is almost a necessity, and to draw the cart, a pony.
The forest pony is thus of great importance to the
forest gipsy; she is hardy, gets her own living, is
cheap to buy when young, and is a source of
wealth. Every forest gipsy is a potential breeder
and dealer; the pony is at once his passion and his
temptation. If he has no ponies to sell at the
autumn sales, there is less money to tide over the
winter.

Therefore the ponies wandering at will, unnoted
by their owners, as free to wander as the
wild creatures, have a great interest for the gipsy,
who regards the products of the forest as his lawful
tribute. The ploverâs eggs, the rabbit, hedgehog
and squirrel, the flowers and ferns, either
supply him with food or put money in his
pocket. But the pony is marked and tail-cut,
plain signs that it is the acknowledged and registered
property of its owner, and not to be appropriated
with impunity. Of course, by far the
greater number of gipsies are strictly honest in
regard to ponies, having learned like the rest of
us, from experience, that honesty is the best
policy; but to some an unmarked yearling pony
must be a temptation, when a branding-iron is
always present in the shape of any iron bar handy,
to be thrust in the fire kept constantly burning.

One autumn, on the edge of the forest just
outside a sheltering wood a small encampment
consisting of three gipsy tents and a caravan
nestled. As night fell the noise of people talking
and children playing ceased, for the gipsies go
early to bed, and rise betimes. The evening meal
had been eaten, the youngsters snuggled to sleep
in corners, and only a few men and women sat
around their fires smoking, for most had had a
long day going to town to sell their wares, and
were glad to seek repose.

Behind the tents, in a little blind lane with high
hedges ending at a gate, a mare was tethered.
She had been deprived of her foal and grieved
noisily, whinnying loudly ever and again. Away
on the moor ponies were grazing, and hearing the
repeated call of the bereaved mother, they put up
their heads for a moment. At last Skewbald,
now a two-year-old, and another pony of the same
age, a dull bay, could stand it no longer, and
sidled away from the herd in the direction of the
call. As they approached the silent tents, the
bay whinnied, and the mare responded so appealingly
that the two quickened their pace to a trot.
A big lad, lounging by the fire in the nearest tent,
looked out as they passed, and then crawled away
silently.

Skewbald and his companion went right up to
the mare, which tried hard to get away from her
tether, whinnying repeatedly, so that the two-year-olds
did not notice several dark figures creeping
towards them in the obscurity of the ditch.
But when a man stumbled, the two ponies made
off up the lane, only to be brought up short by
the gate. Their pursuers, close at their heels,
threw themselves at their necks, and soon the two
were haltered and secured.

An older man came out and examined the
captives. Then in no measured terms he abused
the captors for troubling to tie up a pony marked
like the skewbald, an animal of such striking
colour and pattern, and probably well known to
commoner, keeper, and agister. It was as good
as giving themselves up to the police to have it in
their possession for a moment, and he ordered the
crestfallen young fellows to release it at once.
This was done, and, with a stripe on his flank to
help him along, Skewbald was turned loose, and
made off towards the herd. Then the man gave
his attention to the bay, and pronounced him
ordinary enough to keep. But what were the
marks, if any? A lantern was brought, and the
capitals C. F. were found on the shoulder. A bar
was heated and it was not difficult to convert the
marks into O. E., though much to the discomfort
of the young bay. His tail marks were cut right
away as well. Then it was mooted whether the
pony should not be taken off at once, but this was
pronounced against, as likely to arouse the suspicion
of the police, if met with on the way. In
a day or two a huckster would come along with a
string of ponies, and among them the bay would
not attract notice.

But unfortunately for the gipsies, the agister of
the district, in tall hat with buckle in front, and
green coat with brass buttons, happened to ride by
next morning, on his way to clip the tails of some
ponies lately caught in.

As he passed, he noticed a young bay tied up
behind a tent. Now, the agister knew all the
ponies of his district, and many others in the other
districts as well. Ponies were a passion with him.
He knew them not only by their brands and their
colours, but by their shapes, gait, and size. A
pony once seen by him was never forgotten, and
he could recognize a wanted animal more than
half a mile away. He paused and scrutinized the
bay. Yes, that was Charles Finchâs two-year-old.
He had known it since its birth, and could not be
mistaken. Its tail was short, but not cut after the
fashion of any of the three forest districtsâin
itself a suspicious circumstance. He went closer
and read the letters O. E. No one he knew of in
the forest used such a brand. He got off his pony
and pressed his thumb in the lowest arm of the E,
and the pony winced.

That was enough for the agister, who turned to
several lowering but silent lads and men collected
in a group. âWho claims this pony?â he asked.
There was no answer. âI am positive itâs Charles
Finchâs pony. I shall take it with me if no one
objects;â and he tied the pony to his own, and
trotted away.

After he had done his business, he took the
pony to its owner, who, of course, recognized it
at once. âNow,â said the agister, âthis must
be stopped, or some rogues will give the gipsies
a bad name. Itâs your duty to prosecute the men
where I found the pony.â More he urged of
similar argument on old Finch, who heard him in
silence, and then flatly declined to take any proceedings
whatever, âI got the pony back, thanks
to ye; and much obleeged, Iâm sure. But I does
business with the gipsies, and most of âem are a
pretty good sort, and stick to their bargain. If I
prosecuted eâer a one of them, we should never get
on again. Iâm out for peace and quietness with
my neighbours, and I shanât let a pony come
between us.â And though the agister, having to
take an official view of the matter, protested, at
heart he felt there was much to be said for the
old manâs decision.

One wet afternoon towards the end of September,
the colt-hunter was in his stable mending some
harness. A yell from his youngest boy made him
jump, and he half-rose to see what was the matter,
but turned to his work again, as the boyâs little
sister let forth a shriek of delight. âUp to some
lark,â he muttered, then started, as both children
shouted at the top of their voices, âPeter!
Peter!â At the same instant the gate slammed,
the sound of a heavy boot was heard, and the man
tumbled outside, with the harness in his hand, to
find himself face to face with his eldest son in full
kit, tin hat, rifle and bandolier, and slung around
with billycans, etc., his boots still coated with
the white slime of the French hills.

âPeter!â âFather!â came out at one breath,
and as they grasped hands, their faces came together,
and they kissedâan odd thing, perhaps,
for forest men to do, but a son coming home from
the war unexpectedly was a thrilling moment, and
apt to break down even the reserve of a lifetime.
Peter, never forgotten for a single day, though
not always mentioned by his parents, suddenly
appearing, as if from the skies, was enough to
make his father gasp, unable to utter more than,
âWell, lad!â Then Mother, apprised, came
rushing forth, full of joy, and yet of wrath at not
being the first to salute her firstborn. She hugged
and kissed him until he begged for mercy. âThe
ladâs tired, Mother,â said the father; âletâs in,
soâs he can get his things off, and have a wash;â
and Peter wanted this last badly. How the
youngsters revelled in the tin hat and its dents,
while the father spent some time cleaning his sonâs
boots. âQuite a bit of France,â he said, as he
carefully swept the chalk off the bench into an
empty matchbox.

You should have seen Peter eat, when he got
among his motherâs tarts and cakes. It appeared
that he had the usual fourteen daysâ leave, of
which some time had already expired since he left
Havre. âWhat a shame!â exclaimed his mother.
âHowever, we wonât think of going away yet;â
and everyone was happy, though later on, as Peter
inquired for first one and then another of his old
schoolfellows, faces fell, and answer was made
sadly. After tea Peter felt a bit sleepy, so the
youngsters were sent off to play elsewhere, while
he stretched himself on a couch before the fire.
He had to be wakened for supper, but he didnât
mind, and said he would rather be called anything
than late for meals.

The next morning, of course, Peter wanted a
mount, and inquired what ponies were about.
âYou know the three in the stable,â said his
father; âand thereâs a blue roan mare in the
paddock, but sheâs not properly broken in yet, and
youâll find her rather skittish.â Whereupon
Peter, like a true forest lad, declared she would
be just the thing for him, and with the aid of his
two brothers, drove her into the yard and secured
her.

When he mounted in the paddock, the mare
treated him to a few plunges, which he did not
repress too sternly; and once out in the open,
went off at a great pace, her rider leaving her to go
where she listed, sure that she would keep away
from unsafe ground. But after letting off her
steam with a good run over the heavy ground, the
mare slackened her speed, and Peter could take
stock of the old familiar sights and sounds. Perhaps
the forest never looks so lovely as in autumn,
and especially when well soaked. The heather
still purpled the moorâa rich purplish-brown
flecked here and there with jewel-like pools. Towards
the uplands, and in the woods, the wet
bracken had changed its usual autumnal orange
for a rich sienna. Once Peter glimpsed a pony,
all deep chestnut, with mane and tail of the same,
a âself-colouredâ animal, hardly visible against
a bank of bracken. Only its movements betrayed
it, and then its foal, dark of hue, was discovered
where before it had been âlostâ in the obscurity
of a holly-brake.

Out in the open, the lad took all to his heart,
its beauty and its appeal. A green woodpecker
loped away from an ant heap where it had been
probing, and a covey of partridges scattered from
the ponyâs hoofs. The forest ponies, singly or in
groups, gave life and focus to the landscape, and
Peter saw that it was good.

Then as the mare started to run again, his hat
was twitched from his head by a holly-branch. He
reined the pony in, and essayed to pick up the hat
with his whip, but having no crook to the butt,
could not manage it. âHold on, old girl,â he
said, dismounting. But it was precisely at this
moment that Skewbald, now a three-year-old,
grazing at a little distance by himself, and feeling
lonely, gave vent to a loud call. The grey
whinnied, and began to move off, just as Peter
retrieved his hat, then, as he pulled on the reins,
she kicked sharply, getting the lad on the right
shin. There was a sharp crack, and Peter let go
the reins with a grunt, stood motionless a moment,
and then slithered gently to the ground. As he
did so and disturbed the broken leg, he shouted
with pain, and the mare, already making off, increased
her pace, the reins dangling from her
neck.

A girl was bowling along a forest road on a
bicycle. Joan Barton, V.A.D. nurse in the forest
hospital, had changed out of her uniform, and was
taking advantage of her spell off to get some open-air
exercise. She admitted to herself, as she spun
along, that her own Surrey commons, beautiful as
they are, could not compare in extent and wildness
with the forest. She noted how the road
wound, and led the eye over the moors and hills,
and what a fine surface mere sand and gravel
made, resilient and mudless in spite of recent heavy
rain. As the forest people say, the more it rains,
the better the going. Much better than in dry
weather, when the surface gets loose and covered
with stones.

Presently a grey pony, saddled yet riderless,
and standing by a dead tree a little from the road,
caught her eye.

She looked right and left for a rider, but saw
no one. Then, acting on an impulse, she got off
her bicycle, and went up to the pony. It moved
as she came close, and she saw that the reins were
held on a snag. âFunny way to tie up a pony,â
she said half-aloud; she knew something about
horses, and had acted as groom in a remount
stable while waiting for a vacancy in a hospital.

Some distance away was a herd of ponies
scattered over the moor. Among them she noticed
one patterned in bright chestnut and white, with
the passing thought, that she had not before seen
this striking coloration among all the forest pony
hues. She went to her bicycle and stood scrutinizing
the landscape, but she saw no one. Then her
attention was drawn to a patch of white like a
piece of paper dangling on a bush. But as she
looked she saw the white patch wave to and fro
like a flag, and with a sudden jump of the heart
she realized that it was a flag, and spelling out
letters. She knew the code, being an enthusiastic
leader of Girl Guides, and watched the flag spell
out the letters h-e-l-p. That was enough for Joan.
Close to where she stood, a pony track meandered
in the direction of the signal, and mounting her
bicycle she bumped along it, almost falling off in
her anxiety to watch the flag. It disappeared, but
again showed itself wagging to and fro, then
wavered and fell. She had to get off her bicycle,
and pushed it hurriedly along. There behind a bush
lay Peter, his face wrinkled with pain, yet full of
relief at the welcome sound of the girlâs approach.
He was the first to speak. âMorning, miss;â
and he made shift to smile. âMy pony got me
on the right tibia. But a clean fracture, I think.â
Peter got this out all in a breath. He had had
enough warning of the girlâs approach to concoct
his speech, and was rather proud of his knowledge
of anatomy picked up in the first-aid class. Joan
smiled too, pleased to find her new patient collected
and cheerful. âBeen here long?â she
asked. âNot more than an hour, miss. I live
over there,â he went on, âbut itâs a matter of
three or four miles away.â âAll right,â said
Joan, âbut your leg had better go in some sort
of splints before we can think of your being
moved.â

Then in response to a certain shade of anxiety
on Peterâs face, she added, âItâs all right, I wonât
hurt you more than I can help. Iâm a nurse at a
V.A.D. hospital.â âA nurse,â chortled Peter;
âit seems Iâm having all the luck.â

âWell,â she laughed, âit doesnât seem like it.
I donât think Iâll take the puttee off. Iâll look
for some stuff for splints.â She hunted round for
some straight sticks, and Peter lent her his great
knife, which he had to open for her, so that she
could remove the knots. Then she put on the
splints, using Peterâs other puttee. âDonât be
afraid to make a noise if I hurt you,â she said,
but Peter made no sign of pain except for a grunt
or two. As she worked she talked. âIt was
clever of you to signal,â she remarked. âCleverer
of you, miss, to see and understand,â responded
Peter; ââ¯âtwas a good job Mother put out white
hankies for me this morning. My khaki ones went
into the washtub.â

Joan told him of the grey pony on the hill, and
Peter recounted the cause of his accident. âHow
long, nurse, before Iâm able to go back?â he
asked.

âYouâll not be much use under two months.
Your stay in Blighty will be longer than you
expected.â

âWhatâll my sergeant say?â chuckled Peter.
Joan made a cushion of bracken for the injured
leg and put another armful under his head.
âNow,â she said, âIâll go back to the road for
help.â

âBut whatâs that, nurse?â exclaimed Peter,
and Joan also heard a manâs call. A moment later
a waggon laden with logs emerged from a wood,
some distance away, a man and a boy in attendance.
Joan ran across to them, and explained the
situation. âWhy, that must be young Peter,â
said the man; âI met him yesterday, all loaded
up, on his way home. Weâll do what we can,
miss, but our wood-waggon ainât no use, you see,
for itâs got no bottom. Whatâll we do about
shifting him on to the road?â

But the boy was not a Scout for nothing. This
was his moment, and he made the most of it.
âWhy, dad,â he said, âthatâs easy. You cuts
down two poles, and I gets them two sacks weâve
got on the seat, and makes holes in the corners.
Then we puts the poles through the holes to make
a stretcher, and carries him up to the road.â The
elders agreed that this was feasible, but without
enthusiasm, for fear of engendering pride in the
young.

The man got his axe and cut down two young
birches, remarking that he sâposed âtheyâ
wouldnât mind his cutting green wood for once,
while Joan and the boy prepared the sacks. When
the stretcher was ready, they laid it on the ground
beside Peter, and carefully placed him in it, packing
his legs and feet with bracken, so that the
injured limb should not be jolted.

Then the man taking the poles at the head, and
Joan and the boy a pole each at the other end,
they marched slowly up the hill, Peter insisting
on their keeping step, and giving an imitation of
his sergeantâs pronunciation. Once, as they
crossed a little forest bridge, he gave the order,
âBreak step,â but they refused, for fear of jarring
his leg, whereupon he promised them all C.B.

When nearly at the road, they heard the noise
of an approaching car, and all shouted together,
the boy nearly letting go in the excitement of the
moment. The driver both heard and saw. He
stopped, and matters were soon arranged. The
patient was carefully deposited in the car with
Joan as attendant. The boy was to go back to
fetch Joanâs bicycle and ride it to the hospital,
then, returning, would ride the grey mare back to
Peterâs home. Joan was much averse to this
arrangement, protesting that the pony had done
enough mischief already that day. But the boy
grinned, for he could ride anything in the forest
barebacked, and his family mantelpiece was
adorned with cups and trophies won in the forest
junior competitions. Remarking that he wouldnât
âcome to no harm,â he dashed down the hill
for the bicycle, while the man, after seeing that
the grey pony was properly tied, returned to his
waiting team.

Then came Armistice Day, or rather, in this
quiet corner of Britain, Armistice Night, for in
the forest was not to be seen such ebullition of
spirits as in Regent Street, where, for instance,
two middle-aged clergymen, with ribbons in their
clerical hats, danced along the pavement playing
tin whistle-pipes. But a great fire was to be lit
on the hill above Peterâs home, and all that afternoon
men and boys had been carting up logs and
branches gleaned from the woods.

Most of the local forest people were there, including
Tom, Molly, and the two small children.
Peter, now getting about with a stick, having discarded
his crutches, was sent up in the pony-trap,
the hill being deemed too steep for him.

When the fire died down and people were beginning
to disperse, a girl wheeling a bicycle
passed Peter and his family. Tom let out a shout:
âMiss Barton!â and she stopped. She had seen
Peter several times since he had left hospital;
indeed, he said his leg wouldnât get well unless
she continued to take a friendly interest in his case.
So she had paid visits, when not on duty, Peter
and she sitting in the porch, looking on to the
forest, talking and reading.

Peter was saying that the hill was too steep and
rough to cycle down at night, and his leg felt well
enough for him to walk down if Miss Barton would
lend him an arm in case he stumbled. Tom would
walk the bicycle down, which he was glad to do,
though directly he was out of sight he got on, and
nearly came a cropper avoiding some people going
home.

So Joan and Peter went down together, taking
a little path he knew of, and on the way they saw
the dim forms of ponies on either side, all with
heads down, browsing. Only one, the nearest,
looked up, and snorted as they passed. It was
Skewbald, and Peter suddenly found his tongue,
for neither he nor Joan had had much to say to
one another.

âWhy, thatâs the beggar that upset my applecart,â
he said, and proceeded to narrate for the
twentieth time how the call of the three-year-old
had caused his accident. Then with a flash of
inspiration he continued: âLucky for me that he
called when he did.â

âYes,â said Joan, though she felt in her bones
what was coming; âyou mean he got you a long
leave.â

âI mean,â declared Peter, though his heart
thumped, and he had a strange difficulty in articulating,
âthat if it hadnât happened, we might
never have met.â And so on, but as this is a tale
about ponies and not people, it will suffice to say
that before they reached the bottom of the hill,
they were Joan and Peter to one another, and that
soon after Peter was demobilized the wedding
took place.

The summer had been hot and rainless, and the
beginning of August found the moorland of the
forest drier than the oldest commoner had known
it. Boggy places which had formerly to be skirted
with care were now firm under foot. The tussock
grass was white and sear, the fern orange and
brown, while the leaves of the oaks were eaten
by myriads of caterpillars into delicate lace-like
filigree.

The blackberries withered without ripening,
except where they grew in the meadow bottoms,
still green, though the streams dwindled, until in
the gravelly, quick-running parts, there was
hardly enough water for the troutlets to scuttle
past into the deeper pools.

One midday, on the road between Southampton
and Lymington, a tramping sailor was resting by
the roadside. He lit his pipe, and being a careful
man, blew at the match before he threw it down.
Then he rose, and continued his journey. But
the end of the match still glowed, and the dry
grass in contact with it, fanned by the wind, began
to smoke, and then to ignite with a tiny flame,
which crawled along the ground, until it came to
the dry stump of a fir, its base littered with bits
of bark and dead branches. These sputtered, and
the fire began to spread. The wayfarer had passed
on unheeding, for he was facing the wind, and
therefore received no warning of what was happening
behind him.

Down under the big trees the colt-hunter and
his two boys were cutting the fern for stable
bedding. He had the right to get all he wanted,
though authority decreed that he was not to pick
and choose, not to cut only where the fern grew
thick and tall. He must clear his way steadily,
even where it was sparse and stunted. This year
it was pretty short everywhere. The man used a
scythe, the boys were armed with sickles. At
intervals they drew the fodder into small heaps
for carting.

The father straightened himself and sniffed.
âSeems like burning. Another heath fire, I
expect. Glad if it burnt up the gorse, but sometimes
it burns up other things.â âWhat things,
dad?â asked the younger boy. âTrees which we
want for firewood, and barns, ricks, and sometimes
homes. Run up the hill, sonny, and see if you can
make out whereabouts the fire is.â The boy did
not run; it was too hot. As he walked away, a
shrill whinny was heard, then repeated again and
again. âMy word!â exclaimed the man; âthat
pony is some excited. Seems as if it came from
the farm. Whatâs a forest stallion doing there?â
Just then in the quiet air a prolonged whistle was
heard. The father laid his scythe at the foot of a
tree. âCome on, Tom. Somethingâs the matter,
or mother wouldnât have blown the whistle.â It
was an agreed-on signal. Back the two went, and
the younger boy caught them up, saying he had
seen a great cloud of smoke, and it seemed right
over the house.

âNonsense,â said his father; âmore like five
miles away.â They walked quickly along the
forest avenue of gnarled oaks, tall beeches, and
odds and ends of hollies of no especial shape.
âLook at all those ponies outside the gate!â exclaimed
Tom. There was a restless, pawing, snorting,
whinnying troop of mares and youngsters,
but all with head over or turned towards the closed
gate. When the three reached the farm, they saw
Skewbald standing on the straw heap, surrounded
by pigs, poultry, and ducks. Mother was standing
at the garden gate with the baby in her arms. The
skewbald whinnied when he saw the arrivals and
stamped impatiently. The man sniffed again
and muttered: âThat fire seems closer than I
thought. Howâd he get in?â he called. âHe
jumped it,â his wife replied. âI saw him.â

They opened the gate, and the ponies surged
in after them. Tom ran to slide back the big
door, and had just time to flatten himself against
the wall, when Skewbald thundered past, followed
by the herd, right across the meadow to the ford,
which they crossed. Then they turned, faced the
wind, and snuffed the air.

âBoys,â the father was saying, âthis fire must
be nearer than we want. The smokeâs getting
thicker every minute. Both of you get a broom,
and letâs get beyond the wood.â

The homestead was enclosed to the south-west
by groves of hollies and a plantation of firs. If
these began to burn, sparks might set the thatched
roof and hayricks on fire. Beyond the wood was
a level tract of heather and gorse. The fire might
not have caught this, and there might yet be time
to stop it spreading to the wood. When they got
beyond the trees, the gorse bushes at the far end
of the open space were burning with a loud crackling,
and on the ground a line of smoke, with here
and there a sputter of flame, showed that the fire
was crawling towards them.

Then commenced a fight with the advancing
enemy, in the face of sparks and thick, pungent
smoke. The boys worked bravely, but the wind
fanned the embers, and, often, after they had
beaten down the flames they had to run back, and
put out a fresh outburst. Then, where the grass
and heather was longer, the fire began to burn
more vigorously.

âGet back, boys; weâll wait and fight it where
itâs shorter,â said the father. âHooray!â Tom
exclaimed; âhere they come!â First a man on
a pony, then a boy on a bicycle, two more friendly
helpers in a trap, all coming to help as fast as they
could; and later, a motor-car from the big house
on a hill miles away, and crammed with helpers,
hooted its arrival.

Some had brooms or beaters, and some took
branches, but all fell to with a will, yet as
they worked, the cloud of smoke seemed to get
blacker and heavier. Instead of mounting into
the sky like a pillar of cloud, it hung about their
heads until they could hardly breathe. The sky
became black, and still the fire defied their efforts.

A boy looked up and yelled, âRain!â He had
felt a drop on his face. Someone felt another, but
they were not leaving anything to chance, and
smacked steadily away at the smouldering
herbage.

Then the rain began to come down steadily until
everyone had a wet shirt. When the danger was
over the volunteers began to move off, saying they
must be going, in spite of entreaties to come back
to the farmstead. They knew that the wife with
her baby would be sore put to it to entertain so
many. But one or two who lived farther off were
persuaded to come along, and to these the colt-hunter
expatiated a dozen times on the fortunate
circumstance of the ponies running from the fire,
and taking the road through the wood to the farm.
As Tom said, the skewbald rang the firebell for
them.

Skewbald, now a four-year-old, had in late
August succeeded to the leadership of the company
with which he had been running. The
stallion which had lorded it over the herd had
been âcaught in,â and Skewbald had stepped
into his place as the acknowledged superior of the
young males. It was destined to be a temporary
supremacy, for, as a skewbald, he could not be
welcomed as a breeding stallion; his coloration
was too pronounced. Self-coloured browns and
bays were considered to be truer to the forest type.
Skewbaldâs lot was to be that of a pit pony.

No young stallion challenged him to battle
twice, for Skewbald possessed, besides strength,
a spirit, a quickness of movement together with a
power of deciding rapidly, and when roused, a
fighting temper which boded ill for an enemy.

As a future pit pony he had the merit of not
being too tall, but he was perfectly proportioned,
and his carriage and ease of movement proclaimed
his fitness as an instrument of strength and speed.

Patterned as he was in bold chestnut and cream-white,
his coat did not show the high lights
rippling over the muscles of a bay or black, but the
slinging of his barrel between his shoulders and
flanks, the arch of his neck and withers, the action
of his fore-legs, and the tension of his hocks,
marked him as beyond the ordinary.

His mane, very bushy, and like his tail waved
as with a ladyâs curling-irons, was white nearly to
the regions of his ears, where it turned to chestnut
with an intervening streak of purplish-black. His
long, ample tail, carried in a drooping curve, was
white above and dark below. His on-side had one
great chestnut patch covering most of his barrel
and flank, and extending below the hock. From
a distance, this side was deceptive, because the
great brown blotch looked like a pony standing
end on. The offside had the neck and face chestnut,
and a spot of the same on his barrel smaller in
area than on the other side, and leaving his hind-leg
white.

But although he looked and acted like a born
leader, kept the yearlings and two-year-olds in
their places, rounded up the mares and saw that
all were on the move when the herd was changing
quarters, and, last but not least, glanced continually
round the horizon for enemies in the shape of
agisters or other colt-hunters, it must not be supposed
that he decided all the movements of his
company.

Some of the mares were years older than he, and
knew the forest infinitely betterâthe grassy lawns
and bottoms, the bare âplains,â wind-swept in
hot weather, and the great woods with sheltered
recesses in drenching rain. So they, as a rule,
took the initiative and decided when to move and
where to go. But the direction once indicated,
Skewbald took charge and acted as convoy.

In the herd was an old rusty-black mare with
white forehead blaze and off hind-sock. She had
been broken in for riding and was shod, as might
be seen by her footprints, the imprint of the
double line of the shoe showing out among the
single, nearly circular curves of the unshod
ponies.

In her time she had assisted in the âcatching
inâ of many a pony, and now that she was again
in the forest, although she had lost the timidity
of the uncaught beasts, she made up for this by
the wiliness of one who knew the ways of man.
Time and time again the colt-hunters wished her
far away, when they found her in company with
ponies they wanted. They might manÅuvre the
group at a gentle trot across the moor, but just as
they approached a tempting open gateway, the
mare would check, toss her head, snort, and break
away at a gallop, followed by the rest, in spite of
shouts and cracking of whips.

She was also a persistent wanderer, a âlane
haunter,â âlane creeperâ or âromeoâ (an
atrocious Forest pun)âthat is, a pony which
escapes from the forest into the lanes to munch
the sweet grass of the hedgerows. This is considered
one of the worst vices in a forest pony,
because she leads others with her. Then the
agister may impound the culprits, and the owners
have to pay for any depredations, as fence-breaking
and crop-spoiling, that may have been committed.
Prizes are offered for well-bred ponies
in good condition, but are likely to be withheld
unless the agister certifies that the selected beasts
are no âlane haunters.â Some think that the
introduction of alien blood has brought into
existence a type of animal unsuited to the rigours
of the forest, too delicate to flourish on the meagre
fare, and therefore inclined to wander away in
search of richer food.

By a mischance, the mareâs last foal had died
soon after birth, and because of this, perhaps, she
was this season unsettled, restless, and still more
inclined to wander. The summer, too, had been
hot and dry, so the forest pasturage was meagre
and scanty, the ponies having to search continually
for their fare.

Whereas a herd keeps usually within an area of
four or five square miles, this mare, whether owing
to the above reasons or her innate tendency to
wander, during this season kept the company on
the move by her restlessness and persistence, so
that without hurry, or causing fatigue to the
youngest, and feeding as they went, the forest
was explored from end to end. She was Skewbaldâs
favourite mare; when she went ahead, he
followed, and the herd fell in behind, in the usual
column of route.

She knew the forest roads and lanes both as a
riding pony and a âlane creeper,â the short-cuts,
the hunting bridges, the deep recesses of the
woods, and the narrow winding pony paths across
the upland âplains,â as if she had the ordnance
map in her head.

After whiling away a hot afternoon cooling
their fetlocks at Potterne Ford, the herd spent
the evening on Blackdown near the great round
barrow, and in the early morning, before dawn,
the mare led the way southward over bare ridge
and through thick woods, until coming out on
the Beaulieu road they found the manor gate left
open by a sleepy carter, and trooped down in the
early morning, past Beaulieu Abbey gateway,
pausing at the margin of the beautiful estuary
with its wooded banks, and yachts anchored at
the bend. All was quiet except for the yelping
of a few black-headed gulls questing for food
among the pools, fringed with tawny seaweed left
by the tide.

Skewbald advanced to sample the water, then
snorted with disgust, and retreated, driving his
company on to the road again. The old mare had
a good drinking-place in mind, and led them
up the street until they were stopped by Hatchet
Gate. The gatekeeper, just getting up, heard the
clatter of hoofs. âMore lane haunters,â she
said; âI must let them into the forest again, or
they will get into trouble.â She hastened down,
the herd passed through, trotted on to Hatchet
Pond and slaked their thirst.

They spent some days on the great aerodrome
of Beaulieu Heath, whence, in the days of war,
the aeroplanes buzzed on their way across Blackdown
to attack an imaginary enemy plane marked
as a cross of white gravel on the ground. Now all
was quiet, rows of huts and buildings stood silent
and deserted. The lane creeper took the road
again and led the troop towards Lymington.
Down the hill they went, past the monument to
the gallant admiral of the many virtues duly set
forth, and hesitated at the toll-bridge, where the
collector, waiting awhile to see if any human was
following with the toll dues, drove them back.
They turned up the road bordering the left bank
of the Lymington River, and soon found themselves
in the forest again, but on the other side,
for they forded the river, went over Sandy Down
and crossed the Brockenhurst road, where a sorrel
mare nearly lost her foal, which insisted on nosing
a chunk of bread oblivious of a charabanc of excursionists.
They scattered over Setley Plain,
where are the two tumuli with intersecting rings,
and crossing under the railway, wandered about
the uplands above Sway, with its tall tower, a
landmark visible far out to sea. Here, sunning
themselves by a narrow forest railway bridge,
they encountered another herd, a mere group,
with that rarest of forest poniesâa white stallionâin
charge. He was white, of course, because
of his age; his backbone stood up and his ribs
showed; but though he snuffed the air, there was
no trouble, for the old fellow had no thought of
showing fight, nor was this the season for dissension.
All Skewbald wanted, for his part, was to
get his company over the bridge, and when the
others understood this, they made way willingly
enough.

The wanderers straggled with many stoppages
over the great open moors and uplands of the
Rhinefield Walk. In the forest a âwalkâ is not
a pathway, but a district of several square miles,
formerly presided over by a ranger, an office now
abolished.

They crossed Black Knowl, forded the pretty
stream gurgling over its gravelled bed, and were
soon cropping the fine greensward of beautiful
Balmer Lawn. Here Skewbald had a tussle with
a young iron grey who thought the lawn belonged
to him. After a short passage of arms, Skewbald
disabused him of this notion, and the youngster
retired hurriedly.

The herd wandered through the picturesque
drives leading from the lawn, and drank at the
little pond on the golf-links, set like a jewel on
the breast of the moor.

The young grey stallion had some cause for
jealousy, for Skewbald noticed a white mare with
a great blotch of jet black on her neck and fore-quarters,
and she took his eye, being spotted himself;
but she refused to leave her beloved pastures;
she was no wanderer, and never had been known
to stray more than half a mile from her birthplace,
a field by the lawn.

Then rain came at last, and the mare crossed
the river again and led her party into the woods.
They wandered through the glade of the Queen
Bower, with its great beeches, crossed the Blackwater,
and so into the thick woods of Vinney
Ridge. Here they had a fright one midday, for
the baying of hounds, tootling of horns, and
tramping of hoofs dismayed all but the old mare,
who had often ridden with the buck-hounds. She
led her party, which were inclined to scatter,
down a drive away from the noise. Later in the
week the rain ceased, and leaving the woods, they
crossed the Ober and slowly climbed the hill to
Wilverley Post, the young foals even daring to
rub themselves against the âNaked Manââa
dead tree reduced to a bare trunk and a couple
of armlike branches stretched out imploringly.
Here they crossed the black tarred road between
Southampton and Bournemouth. It was Sunday
afternoon and the cars were almost in procession,
so numerous were they, the noisy little sidecar
predominating; but the ponies took small account
of wheels. Horns might blow and chauffeurs
curse, but the mares, and especially the foals,
were not to be hurried. As the herd crossed head
to tail, so that there was not room for even a
motor-cycle to pass, the road looked like Piccadilly
at its narrowest part, when the policemen
stop the traffic. All sorts of cars were there,
from Fords to a Rolls-Royce; great charabancs
full of trippers, who threw crumpled paper balls
at the ponies to hurry them up, but without avail,
and the drivers, remembering the warning signs
put up by the R.S.P.C.A., had to curb their
impatience until the last foal had crossed.

The ponies spread themselves over Clay Hill,
went down into the bottoms and up by the steep
road from Holmsley Station into Burley, and
drank at the pond fringed with hollies, on the
golf-links, where one Christmas the scarlet berries
hid the leaves, as the golfers, if they notice such
things, can testify.

They cropped the lawn outside the school,
until the noise of the children coming out sent
them into the woods. They missed Burley,
fortunately, for one of the old forest pounds
stands close by, crossed the road at Vereley,
passed the gipsy encampment, and then reaching
another black road leading to Ringwood, spread
out over the open ground of Picket Post, one of
the finest spots in the forest, because of its altitude
and its views towards the sea. Here one can
see clearly the flanks of the forest hills rising from
the level bottom like hills out of a lake. The
ponies munched the sweet grass on the lawn with
its beautiful little tumulus crowned with hollies,
but unfortunately dwarfed by the great modern
house close by.

Then the unsatisfied maternal instincts of the
old mare surged up within her, an irresistible
impulse to action, and she did what horses, dogs,
and other animals will doâset her face towards
her birthplace. She had been born at Brook, and
old memories of her present surroundings may
have suggested to her the route to the village.
At any rate, the herd were soon travelling slowly
to the north-east. Over Handy Cross Plain they
went, through Kingâs Garden and so to Stoney
Cross, where, from the hill leading down to the
dell of the Rufus Stone, one gets the fine view
across to Brook and beyond.

The mare wandered about several days visiting
the haunts of her youth; then again her
loss came upon her, and she started off across
country, for the spot where last she had seen
her foal.

All this time the wanderings of the ponies had
not been unnoted. People owning ponies had
seen them here and there, and in passing a friendâs
house would call and remark, âI saw your chestnut
mare over by Castle Malwood the other day,â
or the owner of Skewbald might be greeted with,
âYour four-year-old seems a bit of a wanderer.â
If the herd strayed on to a public road where
the agisters might catch them, and involve their
owners in expense, a forest man would spend a
little time chivying them back into the forest.
So they had committed no damage in their fleeting
disappearances from the forest proper. They
had not been impounded, and apparently they
were free as air, yet the owner of any pony there,
with a little trouble and inquiry, could ascertain
its whereabouts and could get it either personally
or by deputy.

The herd came back over Emery Down, the
great gaps in its wooded sides showing where the
Canadian gangs had cleared the timber during
the war. Cleared it in a lazy way, the forest
men remarked, for instead of bending to cut
the tree at its base, they had left many stumps
waist-high. But then, timber is cheap in the
West.

Missing Lyndhurst, by devious ways the ponies
came out on the golf-links, where a yearling got
a smack on the flank from the ball of an impatient
golfer. They crossed the road, and tried the
sweet grass of Pondhead. It was a bright Saturday
afternoon, and a boy with a camera, catching
sight of Skewbald, tried for a snapshot. He
stalked him backwards and forwards, manÅuvring
for a good pose and lighting, until the stallion got
suspicious and annoyed. Disdaining the bridge,
he jumped the streamlet, mounted the hill a few
paces, and called loudly. The mares, not unmindful
of the intruder with his flashing camera,
understood. Without undue haste they gathered
their foals, crossed the little bridge and took the
path up the hill, Skewbald standing sentinel until
he saw they were all on the move, then, pressing
forward, he overtook the head of the column, and
led the way.

Soon there was a quarter of a mile of ponies of
all colours, following the meanderings of the
path, the mares with lowered heads, foals trotting
to left and right. Last of all went an old white
mare with a black sucker silhouetted against her
side. It was a pretty picture. Even in the distance
the energetic action of Skewbald could be
noted; his tossing mane proclaimed him the
leader. It was a picture, and the boy could not
help snapping it, although he knew the distance
was too great.

The old mare no longer led the way, for the
herd had reached its home pasturage. Indeed,
Skewbaldâs owner had already noted his return.
The ponies crossed the road looking down on
Longwater, and passed a night among the lush
bottoms. The next day they wandered eastwards
over Matley Heath. As they approached
the railway embankment to cross under the forest
viaduct, they passed an area of a few acres, which
would have looked strangely familiar to millions
of men of military age. During the war the
trench mortar force had used the place as a training-ground,
and at every few yards a hole gaped,
several feet across and a yard deep.

It was early in September, and Skewbaldâs
owner, who had seen him only once during the
summer, but had had reports of his having been
found in various parts of the forest from agisters
and keepers, decided that he would âcatch inâ
the four-year-old, and get a good price for him
as a pit pony. He settled to do the job himself,
and, with two neighbours who volunteered
to give up a Saturday afternoon, started off in
the direction where the herd had been seen last.
It was fine and clear (âvisibility very goodâ),
and Skewbald was plainly in view more than a
mile away. The ponies were scattered along a
ridge above a narrow valley, the floor of which
was largely occupied by a deep bog.

It was decided to keep out of sight as long as
possible, and come at the stallion from over the
hill, in the hope that he could be driven down to
the bog and surrounded.

But if the horsemen could see Skewbald at a
distance, because of his bold colouring, he could
detect them by reason of his good sight, and
though they had apparently gone right away, he
remained uneasy, marching from one mare to
another. Presently he heard the muffled beat of
hoofs on turf, and called loudly to his companions.
When the three hunters reached the crest of
the hill and looked down, Skewbald and several
mares, with their offspring, were trotting away
towards the head of the valley.

There was nothing for the hunters to do but to
go for it at their best speed. Skewbald, they
knew, like any stallion true to his herd, would not
leave the mares, if he could help it. When they
tired was the chance to get him. But as the
horsemen galloped, the trot of the fugitives
changed to the quicker step also, and though the
riders gained on the herd, Skewbald was always
on the far side, protected, as it were, by the
column of mares, foals, and younger ponies.

Some of the foals soon stopped, and, with their
mothers, fell out of the chase. The other mares
and youngsters carried on, and the pursuit went
on along the ridge, until the bog was turned, and
Skewbald led the way back on the other side.
Then the ponies with him began to slacken, and
the pursuersâ hopes ran high, but Skewbald increased
his speed, and leaving his fatigued company,
galloped on alone. Some little distance
ahead, the bog narrowed considerably, and here a
causeway of gravel had been constructed. Along
this the stallion dashed, and ascended the hill to
where the rest of his leaderless herd had collected.
They began to move as he approached, and
stretching into a gallop, they went with him, this
time down the valley, and being untired, began
to increase the distance from their pursuers.
âHang it!â cried the owner; âwhen these
are tired, and he gets to the other lot after
theyâve breathed, he may keep this up all the
evening.â

Then things happened. One of the riders
essayed to cut off a corner by crossing a marshy
bit. His pony hesitated, and when struck, put
her feet together and shot her rider into the bog.
The others halted, and with shouts of laughter,
watched the muddy figure thrashing about, then,
as he sank deeper, hastily took measures to help
him out. They tossed him a rope and fastened
their end to one of the ponies. Then chaffing
him about keeping his legs straight, they shouted,
âHold tight, Jim!â and setting the pony going,
out came the man with a great squelch. âWell,â
said Jim, as he looked at himself ruefully, âmy
own fault entirely. I ought to have known better
than beat a forest pony baulking at boggy
ground.â

It was getting late, and Skewbald was out of
sight. They decided to abandon the chase and
try again another day.

Then the rain came, filling the bogs and flooding
the streams, and the ponies, according to their
habit, left the open moorlands for the woods,
where they were invisible, save to the forest
keepers, clad in khaki with brass buttons bearing
the crown and stirrup, the latter device derived
from the gigantic stirrup hanging in the court hall
at Lyndhurst.

Skewbaldâs owner made inquiries. A keeper
had seen the stallion in a great wood of oaks and
beeches. The next Saturday afternoon the three
riders again set off. The rain had ceased, and the
sun shone, although the going was heavy. In
the woods the forest paths were churned into
quagmires, but on pony-back it does not matter
if the forest be a bit damp. The ponyâs legs get
the mud.

Skewbaldâs company were grazing in the open,
but in the shelter of the wood, bordered with
groves of silver birches. From afar the hunters
thought out a plan of action. âBest go back,â
said one, âand come at them from behind.
Pâraps we can drive them down the moor and
away from the woods.â As the riders, after a
long detour, were approaching their quarry,
having got almost to the confines of the wood,
a party of jays set up a clamour. âNo use going
quietly now,â grumbled the leader; âbetter
push on as fast as we can.â The ponies had heard
the raucous noise of the jays, and then the trample
of hoofs. When the hunters emerged from the
wood, they were in time to see the last of the herd
dashing in among the trees, hundreds of yards
ahead.

âCome on, lads,â was the cry, and the pursuers
did their best to overtake the fugitives,
who had chosen their country with skill, for they
had fled into a great wood with plenty of undergrowth,
and trees so thick that no background of
sky gave the ponies away. Hollies grew in dense
masses, and clinging honeysuckle and brier impeded
progress. Quick going was impossible, and
every dense brake had to be examined for a lurking
beast. Mares and colts they overtook, and
once they thought they had found Skewbald, but
it was an old white mare running among the trees.
As they got nearer the river, the wood grew wilder
and more difficult, while their ponies sunk below
the fetlocks in the soft stuff. âLetâs go into the
drive and see if we can head them off,â suggested
a faint-hearted one. In the sticky drive were
more ponies, but no Skewbald. With the old
black mare he was sheltering behind a thick clump
of hollies, ready, if he heard the riders approaching,
to move quietly off.

Night came on and the riders gave up the chase in
disgust, vowing that they had had the worst of luck.

After this, the services of the colt-hunter were
sought. He listened to the tale of Skewbaldâs
evasions. âSeems a speedy one, and artful.
Iâll get him, never fear.â

The next morning, the colt-hunter, going out
to shoot a rabbit for dinner, was delighted to see
Skewbald with his mares, placidly wandering on
the moor outside his holding. The rabbit must
wait, and he returned to collect his two helpers
and get the ponies ready. When the three were
mounted, he sent the boy and girl by a circuitous
route to get behind the herd. He himself rode
through the gate which opened on the moor, and
went towards the woods, as being the most
difficult part of the country.

Presently, as he watched the herd, he saw the
stallion raise his head, and a moment later Tom
appeared on the ridge beyond the moor, and came
down the hill at a trot. Skewbald called to his
mares, and set off at a gallop towards the far end
of the moor, where it was crossed by the stream.
The man saw the herd rapidly dwindling in the
distance, and noted with satisfaction that the boy
made no attempt to rush the fugitives, but contented
himself with trotting along the edge of the
moor in the direction they had taken. âSaving
his mount,â the father muttered, and then heard
faint sounds in the distance, which he knew came
from Molly, who had crossed the stream, and with
shouts and gestures was stopping the fugitives.
The ponies halted; then, as their new pursuer
rode at them, they turned, and fled in the opposite
direction. Skewbald had an eye to the hill, its
summit covered with trees, but Tom on guard
saw a suggestion of breaking away, and stopped
it with waving arms and fiendish yells. As the
ponies, apparently free from strenuous pursuit,
slackened to a trot, the colt-hunter met them,
and turning them, quietly followed. Tom and his
sister closed in, and the ponies, in an invisible
net, were shepherded towards the gate, left wide
open. Skewbald, restless and suspicious, turned
and faced the riders gently trotting towards him
at some distance. This left the old âlane
haunterâ in front, and as she approached the
opening, she shied, and broke away, keeping near
the hedge, where there was no rider to forestall
her. The herd turned also, and prepared to
follow, but an unexpected intervention checked
them. The two smallest children had been
awakened by the bustle of getting the ponies
ready, and guessed what was afoot. They had
not been asked to help, but thinking there might
be some fun, they dressed, slipped out, and hid
in the hollies a hundred feet from the gate. As
the mare came towards them they darted out,
and, brandishing sticks, rushed at the herd, meanwhile
letting off blood-curdling shrieks. The old
mare, indeed, used to children, brushed past, but
the ponies following were brought to a standstill,
and as the youngsters jumped into the air, their
arms and legs going all ways at once, making of
themselves frantic instruments of movement and
sound, the nerves of the ponies failed them, Skewbald
turning tail with the rest, and the three
riders, closing in, had no difficulty in passing their
quarry through the gate and into the paddock.
âWell done, kids!â called the father. âClose
the gate! Letâs ride âem into the yard before
they know where they are.â But Skewbald had
turned after passing through the gate, and the
herd was now at the far end of the field. The
hunters tried all ways to get the ponies into the
stable yard, but in vain; they tore past the inviting
opening, but enter they would not. Then
the mare left outside, hearing the trampling of
hoofs, and feeling lonely, gave a loud whinny.
Skewbald caught it amid the noise of tumult. He
broke from the herd, dashed across the field,
through the gravelly ford, then, as he neared the
gate, collected himself, cleared it at a bound, and
joined his partner.

âMy word!â exclaimed the colt-hunter, with
a rueful laugh. âCanât that skewbald jump!
One of you open the gate so that the other ponies
can get back into the forest again. All our
trouble for nothing. Well, weâd better go and
have breakfast.â

The colt-hunter began to fear that his old skill
was deserting him, for in spite of his efforts, the
four-year-old was not yet in the stable yard. At
the first opportunity, the man went out again, this
time alone. The old mare gave the alarm, on
seeing him, and the whole herd was soon trotting
away from their pursuer, who, as they were going
directly from his open gate, refrained from pressing
them too closely, hoping that he might be
able to turn them before long. But the mare led
the way right across the open ground towards the
river where it flowed between densely wooded
banks. They entered the wood, and the pursuer
increased his pace, for in such country unridden
ponies can move much more quickly than a rider.
Directly he got into the deep wood, he had to
twist, and break back for feasible routes, and go
slowly for fear of being wiped off his seat by a
branch. He passed several of the ponies, but
they were not what he sought, and as he got
deeper in the recesses of the wood, he became
puzzled. After some tedious wandering, scratched
and torn by holly, brier, and bramble, he confessed
himself at a loss. âThey may have crossed
the stream again,â he considered. âThis thick
stuff is the worst of all to find him in. I wish I
had my old dog.â Nell had had to be destroyed,
after an accident, but when in her prime had
shown a capacity for following the fugitives as
they threaded through the woods, and on reaching
them, by barking loudly, indicated their
position to the pursuers. The man gave up the
chase reluctantly, promising himself to try again.

He did so the next evening with his boy and
girl. The herd was in sight a mile down the moor.
âWhen we get near them,â said the father, âwe
must hustle, and head them off from the woods.â
But the ponies took the alarm at sight of the
riders, and the old mare, without waiting for the
chase to become hot, set off at full speed for the
woods, followed by Skewbald and a few other
ponies. âWe shall lose them,â said the colt-hunter,
and sure enough, after much wandering
and thrashing the woods, darkness set in, and the
hunters returned, weary and empty-handed.

Again and again they tried to head off Skewbald
from his protector. The mare, from being
disturbed, got so nervous that, at the first sight
of the hunters, she would dart for the coverts,
followed by Skewbald. The colt-hunter cudgelled
his brains in vain for a plan to secure the stallion,
and began to sigh for the good old days when the
forest men, mounted and blowing horns, encircled
a wide area, then with outcry and galloping,
drove all the ponies grazing therein into a
great pound. But, as he said, that would have
made an end of his bread and cheese.

The sun, breaking through the mist of a September
morning, shone on a grassy knoll by a
great wood, where a man was cooking his breakfast.
He was tall, ruddy, with a clear-cut profile
and black hair cut close at the back. He wore a
soft shirt, breeches, and stout boots. His wide-brimmed
hat, jacket, and a towel hung on a bush
close by. As he made his preparations he whistled
âThe Star-Spangled Banner.â

Breakfast in the woods presupposes camping;
no tent, however, showed itself, but a few paces
off was an erection in the form of a lean-to, of
dead branches interlaced with brushwood, and the
whole well thatched with heather and bracken.
Looking up from within, no peep of sky could be
seen; the shack was, in fact, watertight.

The breakfast utensils were placed on a newspaper
spread on the turf. A fire of sticks crackled
in a hollow. Three aluminium saucepans were on
the fire, and the man was stirring porridge in one.
âNearly ready,â he muttered; ânow for the
bacon.â He opened a package, took out two
rashers, placed them in a small frying-pan, took
the porridge-pan off the fire, removed the detachable
handle and fitted the latter to the frying-pan,
which he placed on the fire, now a mass of
glowing embers.

Then he found sugar, poured in milk from an
aluminium milk-can, and ate his porridge out of
the pan while watching the rashers. When these
were turned, he took an egg from each of two
egg-shaped aluminium cases, broke the shells,
and poured the contents on the rashers. When
cooked to a turn, he took the frying-pan off the
fire, and ate the bacon and eggs out of it. Then
one of the remaining saucepans boiled, and he
made coffee. The bread and coffee he took out
of waterproof bags, butter from a small aluminium
box. His first course had been of blackberries
picked from a bush near by. Blackberries are not
plentiful in the New Forest, but occasionally they
are found of a size and lusciousness rarely equalled
elsewhere.

After finishing his breakfast, he took out a
cigar, and began to smoke. As he mused he
talked to himself for company. âGuess this is
some quiet spot: not many birds except woodpeckers,
jays, stonechats, and meadow-pipits,
though I saw a whinchat, a redstart, and two
wheatears yesterday. But I expect they were on
migration. Nothing much to be heard in English
woods after the first week in June. And except
for the kingfisher, they canât hold a candle for
colour against our cardinals and bluebirds.

âAnd no beasts worth mentioning. No bears,
wolves, moose, or porcupines, and only rarely
one sees a fox or a hedgehog. Of course, the deer
show themselves now and then, and there are
always the ponies. A viper here and there, perhaps,
but no rattlers.

âWell, thank goodness, there are no mosquitoes,
and however warm it is, the heat doesnât
amount to much. And the views! Superb!
That walk over Emery Down was delightful. I
wish Sadie was here. Plenty of room in that shack,
and how she would enjoy it. Hard lines, marrying,
and having to leave oneâs wife almost on the
church step.â Here he broke off, and took out
a letter, which he read as one does when there is
no need to hurry, turning back occasionally to
earlier passages, though the letter already seemed
well thumbed. Then he replaced the missiveâwhich
was a long one, and called forth a smile
now and thenâin its envelope, and set himself to
wash up, grumbling at the tenacity of the
remnant of porridge; for once he had forgotten to
fill the pan with water. The bacon rinds and
crumbs he left for any furred or feathered epicures
which might be about; the egg-shells, tea-leaves,
and other rubbish he put down a hole.

Then he began to pack. He had no blankets,
heavy and not too efficient conservators of heat.
His only bed covering was an eiderdown quilt,
which went into marvellously small compass. He
had no less than three air-pillowsâa tiny one for
his head, one in the form of a ring for his hip, and
a pleated one for his shoulder. These and a pair
of plimsolls, with his sleeping suit, went into his
ground-sheet, which he rolled into a long bundle
round a light fishing-rod, with a strap attached to
either end so that he could sling it like a rifle.

The other details of his equipmentâbath and
bucket, of the thinnest and lightest material,
which had been emptied of water and hung up to
dry; milk-can, collapsible cup, plates, saucepans,
each of which he wrapped in paper before putting
one within the other, not forgetting to place the
handle insideâwent into his waterproof knapsack
with food-bag, tins, etc. In a little bag he
put comb, brush, and mirror, all of diminutive
proportions, from which the greater part of the
handles had been removed, in order to reduce
weight, for this was a walking tour, where every
ounce makes a difference. Even a pocket Primus
would have added too much to the burden of the
day. And in the forest, firewood is plentiful.

Once he ceased packing and raised a tiny prism
glass of the most recent pattern, which was slung
round his neck, quickly to his eye, in order to
identify a passing bird. âHave learned quite a
lot about English birds,â he said to himself.
âWhen I go back I shall be able to tell the
Western Reserve Ornithological something about
the English warblers. The nightingaleâs song is
very fine, Iâll admit, especially at night, but give
me the blackcap in clear daylight. He beats the
band.â

When everything was packed, he turned towards
the shack. âBetter leave it as it is,â he
muttered; âI might come back this way and put
in another night.â

As he turned into the woodland path, the
bushes parted and a man dressed in tattered khaki
emerged. He carried a coil of rope over his
shoulder and in his hand a stout cudgel. âGot
the time on ye, sir?â he asked. The camper took
out a gold watch. âI make it nine oâclock. But
I should have thought that you forest men were
in no need of watches with the sun shining.â
âOh, ay!â muttered the man in khaki evasively.
âAh, whatâs this?â he exclaimed, pointing to
the shack. âSleeping rough? Why, thatâs
punishable at the magistratesâ court,â he added
with a grin. âNot at all,â said the other. âI
have my permission, duly signed from Lyndhurst,
to camp in the forest, also a licence to fish in the
streams, although up to the present Iâve caught
nothing but minnows. This is how we camp out
West. Saves lugging a tent about.â âOh,â
said the man in khaki, âyou be an Amurrican;
I thought so, by your twang. What puzzles me,â
he continued, âis why you should be tramping
about here. Most of the Yankees at Winchester
never set foot in the forest. They see it all from
the car. But,â with a sneer, âpâraps you canât
afford it?â The American noticed, but answered
with a smile: âWhy, friend, I could afford it
very well, but all my life I have loved open spaces
and fresh air, and I like to do things for myself.
I am what you might call a cattle-farmer, and
have a ranch in the West.â

âIndeed,â said the other, âand how many
cattle might ye own?â âWell, I am not sure,
anyway,â answered the American, âbut I suppose,
if things are going all right, that my men
have charge of 10,000 head of stock.â âWell,
Iâm ââ,â exclaimed his questioner. âAnd to
think, if youâre worth all that money, you care
to sleep on damp ground with a bit of brushwood
overhead.â

âI said just now,â laughed the other, âthat
Iâm used to outdoor life. When I came over with
my regiment, we were sent to the camp at Winchester.
You know that city?â and the other
nodded. He did not deem it necessary to say that
the last stay he put in there was in the city gaol.
âWell, I got interested in this locality, because
there seemed room to move in it, as there is at
home; and in my spare time I used to come down
here and look about me. Then one afternoon
when I was sitting in the cathedral, while
hundreds of our men, from all over the States,
were being taken round in parties to see the
sights, I had some talk with a man and a boy who
looked in. They were cycling with camping
luggage, and were to spend a holiday in the forest.
I guess they were some novices, for I went outside
to see them off. Never saw such poor, ill-used,
overladen bicycles before or since. Afterwards
I got my knock in the big push, and they
sent me to the hospital at Brockenhurst, where
I saw more of the forest. Just now family
business is keeping me in London, so I thought I
would spend a few days down here, in my own
way.â

The man in khaki became effusive. He thrust
out a dirty tattered sleeve. âWe ought to be
pals, mister. See my wound stripes? Wipers,
Loos. Been through the lot and glad to be back
for good. I suppose you canât raise a drink for a
pore comrade? You gentlemen generally have
a whisky-flask on you.â

âNo, my friend,â replied the American.
âYouâll find no intoxicating liquor in this outfit.
Iâm a prohibitionist, what you call a teetotaller.â
Then, as waves of incredulity, derision, and horror
crossed the otherâs face, he added: âYouâll find
a lot more of us across the Pond. And now,
friend,â he continued, âIâve told you as much
about myself as if you were an agister, as I think
you call him. Why do you appear, like a jack-in-the-box,
and so anxious to know the time?â

âNot much of an agister,â grumbled the man.
âMiserable cusses, I calls âem, interfering with
a pore manâs living. I comes from Romsey way,
but settled down here since the war. A suspicious
lot,â he added surlily. âI drives cattle, carts
wood, breaks in horses, and thatâs what Iâm going
to do this morning,â and he held out the rope.
âAh,â said the American, âthat reminds me of
home. None of my cowboys ride anywhere without
a coil hanging to their saddles. They never
know when they may want to rope a steer or a
mustang.â âWell,â said the man in khaki,
âIâve heerâd tell that the forest people used ropes
in the old days, but they never do now.â

While talking, they had reached the edge of
the wood, and the road, thick with dust, lay before
them. âWell, friend,â said the American,
âyouâll be taking the road; I wish you good-day.
I am keeping to the forest paths.â

âWhy, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyouâll lose yourself.â âNot with a good English
ordnance map,â answered the other, taking
from his breast pocket a folded map. As he did
so, a bulky pocket-book fell to the ground.
âThanks, donât trouble,â as the man in khaki
made a movement, and bending down himself,
picked up and restored his property to his pocket.

But the man with the cudgel was not to be
shaken off. In spite of the Americanâs obvious
reluctance to have his company, he declared that
he had plenty of time and that he would see him
a piece of the way. Once started, the intruder
on the visitorâs privacy became boastful of his
prowess and that of his companions in arms, and
began to decry the American forces, but his
hearer good-humouredly parried his clumsy onslaughts.

As they passed over the moor they came upon
a group of ponies. It was Skewbaldâs herd. He
was grazing, and as the two men passed within a
short distance, he raised his head and looked at
them. But, as they were on foot, and seemed to
have no ill designs on ponies, he turned again to
his own business.

âNow, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyou Amurricans talk very big about lassooing
wild steers and hosses. What about giving us a
show of your skill? Letâs see you catch one of
these ponies.â

âNo, friend,â replied the American, putting
aside the proffered coil; âI donât rope other
peopleâs beasts without their permission, nor do
I wish to show off.â âAll right, mister, donât be
huffy about it,â said the man; âbut that there
stallionââindicating Skewbaldââis worth five
bob to me, if you can rope him. Joe Smith has
been wild to get him for weeks past, but the
skewbald has gone away every time. Only a rope
will get him. You might help a pore man,â he
urged with garrulous earnestness.

âWell,â hesitated the other, âthe ground is
soft, and I am not likely to hurt him, but this
rope is all wrong and may put me off. However,
I can try.â They walked on a little and the
American stopped and deposited his luggage at
the foot of a holly. He tied the noose and re-coiled
the rope to his liking. Then they walked back so
as to pass within a few yards of the stallion. The
man in khaki walked a pace or so behind the
other, gripping his cudgel. He breathed heavily,
looked around him and seemed excited. The
stallion raised his head suspiciously, turned, and
at the same moment the rope shot out and encircled
his neck. Before the pony knew what was
happening to him, the American, bending down,
was taking several turns of the rope round a
stump.

Then two things happened. The stallion,
making off, was brought up short and fell on his
side, half-choked by the tightening of the rope,
and at the same moment, the cudgel fell with a
thud on the head of the man bending at the rope.
He fell forward on his face without a cry. His
assailant looked around hurriedly, then took the
gold watch, pocket-book and loose cash, and
having picked up his stick, was making off without
a second glance at his victim.

But Skewbald struggling on the ground caught
his eye. âWhy,â he muttered, âI nearly forgot
the rope. Good job I didnât quite. Might have
give me away.â He dropped the cudgel, unwound
the rope from the stump, and approached
the stallion.

Directly the pressure of the noose was removed
from the ponyâs windpipe, he revived, and rose
to his feet breathing hard. Then as the man
reached him and took hold of the noose, he reared,
pulling his liberator off his feet, to fall beneath the
plunging hoofs. The stallion, seeing a persecutor
lying prostrate, and being full of anger at his
treatment, with a scream of fury, flew at him,
kicking and biting. Then he seized an arm in his
teeth and savaged it. Launching a final kick, he
galloped to his herd, the rope trailing on the
ground.

The American groaned. He thought himself
again in the trenches, with the enemy âputting
some hot stuff over.â He was sure he had received
a wound at the back of his head, and was
lying face down in mud and blood, dying, yet no
one came to his aid. Then his nose tickled, he
sneezed, and sat up. He felt the back of his head
and looked at the blood on his fingers. He remembered
roping the pony, but rope and stallion were
both gone. What was that lying in a trampled
bush of bog myrtle? He got up and walked unsteadily
to the prostrate form. The face was
marked with cuts and bruises, while one sleeve
was torn, the arm bleeding and hanging oddly.
The American turned him over carefully, and as
he did so, his gold watch fell out of a pocket, its
glass smashed, and here was his pocket-book lying
on the ground. Then he began to understand
somewhat of what had happened to himself and to
the man, for the hoof-marks around told their
own tale. His face set hard, but this ruffian was
in a bad way, perhaps dying. He would do what
he could for him. He went to his knapsack and
took out a first-aid outfit. He bandaged the torn
and broken arm, using sticks for splints. The
pain roused the patient and he began to groan
and curse disjointedly, the phrase âââ skewbaldâ
recurring like a refrain.

The American carried the man to the shade of
a tree. He heard the chink of coin, which he
divined to be his own property, especially when
he found his pockets empty. Then he waited.
The man opened his eyes, and looked at his preserver.
âWhat?â he spluttered, having lost
some front teeth. âYes, my friend,â said the
other, âI am still here, and a good job for you.
I might have left you to bleed to death, and serve
you right. I think you took rather more risk than
you knew,â producing a revolver from a hip
pocket and replacing it. âWell, your legs and
back seem all right, and after a rest you should be
able to make the road and get help. You donât
deserve it, but I think I had better see you there.
No, donât worry,â as the manâs eyes narrowed.
âIâm not going to give you up. You seem to
have been well beaten about, without my trying
to get you more punishment.â

The man sat motionless; the double shock of
the stallionâs attack, and being confronted by the
victim of his brutal violence, for the moment
bereft him of speech and power to stir.

After a while, he attempted to rise, stammering
that it was time he made a move. His rescuer
helped him up, and the man tried to feel in his
pockets. âAll right, friend,â said the American,
âI have got my own back.â

As the injured man proceeded, his strength
failed and he began to stumble. The other had
to support him, to prevent further injury to the
shattered arm. The road reached, the man sank
by the wayside, exhausted.

A cart drawn by a forest pony came along.
The driver stopped. âWhy, who be this? Not
Bill Nokes again? Whatâs he been up to this
time?â he asked with emphasis. The American
hastily explained that he had found the man lying
injured in the forest. âPut him in. Iâll soon
have him in the hospital at Lyndhurst.â

They laid the man on the floor and made him
as comfortable as possible. âYou coming, sir?ââto
the American. âNo,â he replied. âI
cannot be of any further use, and I have to return
for my property.â

He walked back with a splitting headache, a
sore head, and a wonder in his heart that among
the kindly forest folk he should have encountered
an alien, and a black sheep at that. He found his
goods where he had left them, and seeing the
cudgel lying near, added it to his burden as a
memento. He spied also a lock of chestnut and
white hair, sawn from the skewbaldâs mane by
the rope, and put it into an envelope. Then he
said to himself: âBetter get out of this. My
scalp wants seeing to, and the people may wonder
how I came by a broken head.â

He consulted a time-table and estimated (there
were no hands to his watch) that he could catch
a train by walking across country, to Southampton.
âIâll hunt up that doctor who treated me
before, and get my head patched up.â

When the American went to the surgery two
days later for a final inspection the doctor held
out a local paper, saying, âHere are some items
which may interest you.â A pencil mark stood
against a paragraph entitled, âStrange Death of
a Forest Pony,â which related how Skewbald had
been found by a keeper. The rope had caught in
a snag near a deep pit, and in his efforts to free
himself, the pony had fallen down, and broken
his neck. âWell, doc.,â said the patient, âI
did more mischief than I expected, when I fooled
around with that rope, but I will put it right when
I get to town.â

âLook at the next page,â said the other.
This item was headed, âForest Man injured by
a Pony?â and narrated that a man picked up
grievously injured, was doing well in hospital and
pronounced out of danger. It went on to say:
âHe is a somewhat notorious character and well
known to the police. Curiously, after his injuries
had been seen to, and while in a state of delirium,
he frequently muttered imprecations on âthat ââ
skewbald.â Elsewhere we detail particulars of
the mysterious death of a fine skewbald forest
stallion belonging to a well-known forest commoner,
Mr. J. Smith. It is conjectured that the
man may have lassooed the pony (though it is not
known that he possessed any such skill with a
rope), and in some way was taken at a disadvantage
by the animal, which attacked him, and
escaped, only to meet its death shortly afterwards.
The manâs injuries are such as might have been
caused by a stallionâs teeth and hoofs. Such
aggressive behaviour on the part of a forest pony
is of the rarest.â

A few days later, Skewbaldâs owner received a
letter with a London postmark. âDang me!â
he said, turning it over; âwho be this from?â and
getting no answer from the envelope, opened it,
when out came a draft for Â£40, and a letter in
business terminology from a firm of solicitors
intimating that a client of theirs, having heard
through the Press of the death of his pony, hoped
that the owner would accept the enclosed sum
as indemnity for his loss. âWell, well!â exclaimed
the delighted but bewildered man, âthis
beats all. The thing gets stranger and stranger.
Iâm sure that varmint Bill Nokes never roped the
poor beast. Now, these people write as if someone
owed me the money. Iâd better harness the
pony and get this in the bank before anything else
happens.â And not until he had got the draft
safely to the bank, and had seen the clerk initial
it, did he really believe that the skewbaldâs loss
had been made good.
